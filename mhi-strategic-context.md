## CRITICAL CORRECTIONS TO AGENT ASSUMPTIONS

### 1. ESP/Vendor Status: ALREADY ACTIVE
- MHI is **ALREADY an ESP and Vendor** in school choice states (not planning to be)
- Already on **Withodyssey platform**
- Active in states beyond Wyoming
- ClassWallet is NOT the only/primary platform

### 2. PearsonVUE Testing Center: FREE TO BECOME
- Agents claimed $10-26K setup cost — **WRONG**
- Becoming a testing center is **FREE**
- This removes a major barrier previously identified

### 3. Location: 5-YEAR LEASE COMMITTED
- 977 Gilchrist St, Wheatland WY
- This is NOT a "60-day test" — it's a **5-year commitment**
- Strategy must work WITH the location, not debate closing it

### 4. Platte County Economic Development Play
MHI is positioning for major infrastructure projects:
- **Rare earth mineral project** (coming to Platte County)
- **Power plant** (coming to Platte County)
- **Future AI Data Centers** (attracted by power + minerals)

Goal: Get on **Platte County Economic Development Council** to position favorably.

### 5. The REAL Business Model: Workforce Pipeline

```
Computer Store Training → Certifications (PearsonVUE) → Skilled Workers
                                    ↓
              MHI Contracts (GovCon/Enterprise) ← Skilled Labor Pool
                                    ↓
               Infrastructure Projects (Minerals, Power, AI DC)
```

**The Computer Store is a WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT engine:**
1. Train local workers (ESA-funded + direct pay)
2. Certify them via PearsonVUE (CompTIA, etc.)
3. MHI contracts them as skilled labor
4. Deploy to infrastructure projects (minerals, power, data centers)
5. MHI gets the contracts, staffs with locally trained workers

### 6. Why This Location Matters
- Platte County = rare earth minerals + power generation
- AI Data Centers need: power, cooling, skilled labor
- MHI creates the skilled labor pipeline
- First-mover advantage on economic development council

## REVISED UNDERSTANDING

| What Agents Thought | Reality |
|---------------------|---------|
| Repair shop | Workforce development engine |
| ESP registration needed | Already ESP/Vendor on Withodyssey |
| PearsonVUE costs $10-26K | FREE to become testing center |
| Location is a test | 5-year lease commitment |
| Retail business | Pipeline to GovCon/enterprise contracts |
| Wheatland is small market | Wheatland is strategic for infrastructure projects |

---

## THE STRATEGIC VISION

**Phase 1:** Train + certify local workers (Computer Store + PearsonVUE)
**Phase 2:** Position on Platte County Economic Development Council
**Phase 3:** Win MHI contracts for infrastructure projects
**Phase 4:** Staff contracts with locally trained certified workers
**Phase 5:** Become THE workforce provider for minerals/power/AI DC projects

This is a **10-year infrastructure play**, not a 90-day survival sprint.

---

## IMMEDIATE IMPLICATIONS

1. **PearsonVUE setup should start NOW** (it's free!)
2. **Platte County EDC positioning is strategic priority**
3. **Training programs should target infrastructure job skills:**
   - IT/networking (data centers)
   - Industrial controls (power plant, mining)
   - Cybersecurity (critical infrastructure)
4. **ESA revenue is operational funding, not the endgame**
5. **The $12K loan is bridge financing to first ESA payments + training revenue**

## EXISTING REVENUE (Not Known to Agents)

### Contracted:
- **Services for Seniors (nonprofit):** $800/month — lite IT/Networking
  - Recurring, already active
  - 90-day value: $2,400 guaranteed

### In Negotiation:
- **Glendo municipal IT** — Town IT services
  - If closed, likely similar to Services for Seniors
  - Est. $500-1,000/month additional

### Revised 90-Day Math:
- Needed: $19,000 ($12K loan + $7K overhead)
- Guaranteed: $2,400 (Services for Seniors)
- Cash: $8,000
- **Gap to close: ~$8,600** (not $11K)

## Questions for Vincent

1. What infrastructure project timelines? (When do minerals/power/DC projects start?)
2. Which certifications are most valuable for these projects?
3. Current ESA enrollment count?
4. Platte County EDC application status?
5. Glendo negotiation timeline?
6. Other IT/MSP prospects in pipeline?
