## Strategic Context: The Real Business Model

```
Training/Certification (Computer Store)
           ↓
    Skilled Workers
           ↓
MHI GovCon Contracts ← EDWOSB/HUBZone advantage
           ↓
Infrastructure Projects (Platte County)
    - Rare earth minerals
    - Power plant
    - AI Data Centers
```

**The Computer Store is a WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT engine**, not a repair shop.
