# MHI Project Priorities — 90-Day Survival + Strategic Positioning
**Generated:** 2026-02-08 15:50 MST
**Analysis Period:** 90 days (through May 2026)
**Source:** LLM conversation history, email context, strategic documents

---

## Executive Summary

**Financial Reality:**
- Cash: $8,000
- Loan due in 60-90 days: $12,000
- Monthly overhead: $2,330 (~$7,000 for 90 days)
- Services for Seniors (guaranteed): $2,400
- **Gap to close: ~$8,600 in 90 days**

**Key Strategic Corrections:**
1. PearsonVUE testing center is **FREE** to set up (not $10-26K)
2. MHI is **ALREADY** an ESP/Vendor on Withodyssey (not planning to be)
3. Location is a **5-year commitment** (not a 60-day test)
4. This is a **WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT** business feeding MHI contracts

## DECISION FRAMEWORK

When evaluating any project, ask:
1. **Does it generate cash in 90 days?** → Prioritize
2. **Does it require upfront investment?** → Scrutinize
3. **Does it leverage existing assets?** → Favor
4. **Does it position for infrastructure play?** → Consider strategically
5. **Is it maintenance of working systems?** → Keep minimal
