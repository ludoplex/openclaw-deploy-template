## Email 1: D&H Distributing (Richard Smith)

**To:** Richard Smith (D&H Distributing rep)
**From:** rachelwilliams@mightyhouseinc.com
**Subject:** API Access Request - Account #3270340000

Hi Richard,

I'm reaching out regarding API access for Mighty House Inc (Account #3270340000).

We're building an internal procurement system to streamline our ordering process across distributors, and we'd like to integrate with D&H's API. I tried accessing the API documentation at dandh.com/v4/view?pageReq=API but received a 404 error.

Could you help us with:
1. Access to D&H's REST API documentation
2. Developer/API credentials for our account
3. Any onboarding requirements or approval process

We already have API integrations working with Ingram Micro and Mouser, so we're familiar with distributor API patterns.

Thanks for your help!

Best regards,
Rachel Williams

## Email 2: TD SYNNEX (Mikko Dizon)

**To:** Mikko Dizon (TD SYNNEX rep)
**From:** rachelwilliams@mightyhouseinc.com  
**Subject:** API Access Request - Account #786379

Hi Mikko,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding API access for Mighty House Inc (Account #786379).

We're developing an internal procurement application and would like to integrate with TD SYNNEX's Digital Bridge platform. I attempted to access the partner portal at tdsynnex.com/na/us/partner-solutions/digital-platform/ but the page returned a 404 error.

Could you assist us with:
1. Access to TD SYNNEX's API documentation
2. Developer credentials or API keys for our account
3. Information about the onboarding process

We have active API integrations with Ingram Micro and Mouser, so technical integration should be straightforward once we have access.

Thank you!

Best regards,
Rachel Williams
