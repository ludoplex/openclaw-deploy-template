# AI Security: Hype vs Reality

## Gartner Positioning (2025)

**Hype Cycle Status**
- GenAI for security: Trough of Disillusionment
- AI SOC agents: Peak of Inflated Expectations
- Autonomous SOC: "There Will Never Be an Autonomous SOC" (Gartner 2025 title)

**Adoption Reality**
- AI SOC agent market penetration: 1-5% (embryonic)
- By 2027: 30% of SOC leaders will face AI integration challenges
- By 2030: 75% may lose foundational analysis capabilities from over-reliance

## What AI Actually Does

**Proven Value**
- Reduces breach cost: $1.9M savings
- Reduces lifecycle: 80 days faster
- Improves alert triage speed
- Assists (not replaces) Tier 1 analysts

**Does NOT**
- Prevent intrusions
- Eliminate need for human review
- Detect novel attacks reliably
- Replace Tier 2/3 analysts

## Adversarial ML Reality

- 98% detection → 8.81% false positive rate (unacceptable)
- Acceptable FP rates → detection "plummets"
- GAMMA, Mal-LSGAN: Attackers evade ML detectors systematically
- Fundamental tradeoff unresolved

## Vendor Claim Decoder

| Marketing Term | Actual Meaning |
|----------------|----------------|
| "AI-powered" | May be rules engine, basic ML, or GPT API wrapper |
| "Autonomous" | Automated triage requiring human oversight |
| "Zero-day protection" | Behavioral heuristics; not literal zero-day |
| "Real-time" | Often minutes/hours, not seconds |
| "24/7 AI analyst" | Alert enrichment, not investigation |
