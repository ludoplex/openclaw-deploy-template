# Compliance Theater

## The Core Finding

Verizon forensics, 10-year analysis:
> "Of all companies investigated following a breach, not one was found fully PCI DSS compliant at the time of breach."

**Zero percent.**

## Case Study: Target (2013)

- Certified PCI DSS compliant: September 2013
- Breach discovered: December 2013
- Cards exposed: 40 million
- Post-breach finding: Actually non-compliant; assessment failed to identify gaps

## Compliance Decay

- Organizations fully compliant at validation: 100%
- Remaining compliant after 1 year: 29%
- Compliance treated as event, not process

## Security Awareness Training

University of Chicago/UC San Diego study (19,500 employees, 8 months):
> "No evidence that annual security awareness training correlates with reduced phishing failures."

Verizon DBIR 2025:
> "The failure rate (click rate) was unaffected by training."

Yet boards see "95% training completion" as security metric.

## Annual Penetration Testing

- 40%+ report results invalid by delivery time
- CVE exploitation up 34% YoY
- Time-to-exploit: 5 days
- Annual testing cycle: 365 days

Gap: Testing designed for slower era.

## Board Metrics That Mislead

| Reported Metric | What It Actually Shows |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Training completion % | Activity, not effectiveness |
| Patch compliance % | Coverage, not speed |
| Tool count | Spending, not security |
| Audit pass | Point-in-time, decays immediately |
| SIEM alerts handled | Volume, not outcome |
