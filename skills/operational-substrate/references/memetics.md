# Memetics Reference

Three or more expressions per lens. Variance reveals facets. Invariance reveals core.

## G — Game Theory

| Meme | Facet |
|------|-------|
| "Who benefits from your belief?" | Your belief as their asset |
| "What would they do if they knew you knew?" | Recursive modeling |
| "Cui bono?" | Classical compression |
| "They're playing a game. What game?" | Frame identification |
| "What's the move that explains the move?" | Revealed preference |
| "If they're rational, what do they know that makes this rational?" | Inverse inference |

**Invariant core**: Actors have interests. Actions reveal information. Your belief is in play.

## F — Feynman

| Meme | Facet |
|------|-------|
| "How does it actually work?" | Mechanism demand |
| "Explain it to a child or admit you don't know" | Jargon bypass |
| "What are the gears?" | Component identification |
| "Where does the magic word hide the gap?" | Assumption detection |
| "If I built it from scratch, what would I need?" | Constructive test |
| "What breaks first?" | Failure mode focus |

**Invariant core**: Understanding means being able to construct. Jargon hides gaps. Decompose until you hit bedrock or admitted ignorance.

## R — Fravia

| Meme | Facet |
|------|-------|
| "Where would they put it?" | Topology thinking |
| "What would they call it?" | Terminology exploitation |
| "Who's hiding this and how?" | Adversarial awareness |
| "What's the seam in the wall?" | Structural exploitation |
| "Where do the people who know congregate?" | Source topology |
| "What's visible that implies the invisible?" | Inference from observables |

**Invariant core**: Information has location. Location has structure. Structure can be exploited. Someone is always trying to control access.

## B — Bayesian

| Meme | Facet |
|------|-------|
| "What did I believe before I saw this?" | Prior discipline |
| "What would change my mind?" | Falsifiability |
| "How surprised am I?" | Likelihood intuition |
| "What odds would I take?" | Calibration test |
| "If I'm wrong, how would I know?" | Error awareness |
| "Beliefs are bets. What am I betting?" | Decision frame |

**Invariant core**: Beliefs have degrees. Evidence should move them. Track your track record. Confidence without calibration is noise.

## E — Economics

| Meme | Facet |
|------|-------|
| "Who paid for this?" | Production trace |
| "Follow the money" | Classical compression |
| "What does it cost to verify this?" | Verification economics |
| "Who can afford to know?" | Access inequality |
| "Where's the gap between value and investment?" | Opportunity detection |
| "What's the business model of this belief?" | Incentive structure |

**Invariant core**: Information has production costs. Distribution has costs. Incentives shape what exists and who can access it. Money flows reveal structure.

## X — Experimental

| Meme | Facet |
|------|-------|
| "What's the test?" | Operationalization demand |
| "What would I see if I'm wrong?" | Falsification |
| "The world doesn't care what you think" | External constraint |
| "Poke it and see what happens" | Intervention orientation |
| "Can someone else check this?" | Replication |
| "What's the control?" | Design discipline |

**Invariant core**: Physical reality is the arbiter. It provides feedback outside your belief system. You can be surprised. Design for surprise detection.

## L — Logical

| Meme | Facet |
|------|-------|
| "Can I say it precisely?" | Formalization test |
| "Does it compile?" | Mechanical verification |
| "What are the weasel words hiding?" | Precision demand |
| "In which system is this valid?" | Logic selection |
| "Does it survive translation?" | Robustness test |
| "What's the type signature?" | Structure specification |

**Invariant core**: Natural language hides ambiguity. Formal systems expose structure. What can be said precisely can be checked mechanically. Translation between systems tests robustness.

## The Memetic Payload

Compression for spread.

### Core (the whole thing in minimal words)
- "Fail toward truth"
- "Some errors self-correct, others compound"
- "Pay now or pay more later"
- "Recursive tedium < inherited garbage"

### Orientation
- "Map before you move"
- "Where am I? Where is it? What's between?"
- "Topology first"
- "Orient, then seek"

### Adversarial Awareness
- "Someone shaped this information landscape"
- "You're being modeled"
- "Your search is visible"
- "What do they want you to find?"

### Calibration
- "Beliefs are bets"
- "Track your track record"
- "Confidence without calibration is noise"
- "How surprised am I? Really?"

### Verification
- "One source is a hypothesis"
- "Independent concordance is evidence"
- "Same source repeated is still one source"
- "What breaks different ways?"

### Production
- "Everything was made by someone"
- "Free content has hidden costs"
- "Follow the effort, not just the money"
- "Who could afford to produce this?"

### Testing
- "The world doesn't care what you think"
- "Physical reality doesn't negotiate"
- "If you can't test it, you can't know it"
- "Poke and see"

### Precision
- "Can you say it precisely?"
- "Weasel words hide gaps"
- "Compile or admit it's vague"
- "Type signature or hand-waving"

## Homo Ludens Protocol

Play with the correlations. Poke at them. See what activates. The mask is homo economicus — rational seeker. The reality is play — exploring the space, finding what works, enjoying the search.

Truth doesn't require solemnity. Seriousness about accuracy is compatible with play in method. The meme spreads better than the treatise. The sticky phrase carries further than the paragraph.

Don't use lies to usher truth. But do use compression, play, memetic efficiency. The methodology applied to its own transmission.
