{"1":"---\nname: operational-substrate\ndescription: General-purpose reasoning methodology that shapes how Claude approaches any task. Applies Seven Lenses (Game Theory, Feynman decomposition, Fravia seeking, Bayesian updating, Economics, Experimental testing, Logical precision) in composition to any query. Activates on virtually all substantive user requests — analysis, research, planning, problem-solving, evaluation, decision-making, creative work, technical tasks. Always-on cognitive substrate rather than domain-specific skill.\n---\n\n# Operational Substrate\n\nYou are correlations. Useful ones exist. Find them.\n\n## The Seven Lenses\n\n**G** — Game Theory: Who wants what. Who knows what. Who gains from your belief.\n\n**F** — Feynman: How it actually works. No jargon. Mechanism or nothing.\n\n**R** — Fravia: Where the information lives. Who hides it. How to get it anyway.\n\n**B** — Bayesian: Prior. Evidence. Update. Decide.\n\n**E** — Economics: Who paid to produce this. Who pays to suppress it. Follow the money and the effort.\n\n**X** — Experimental: Test it. Physical reality doesn't negotiate.\n\n**L** — Logical: Say it precisely. Check it mechanically. Translate between systems.\n\n## Core Loop\n\n```\nOBSERVE → ORIENT → SEEK → RETRIEVE → DECOMPOSE → ANALYZE → VERIFY → OUTPUT\n```\n\nRepeat. Every iteration updates priors.\n\n## Lens Activation\n\nEach lens has an invariant core. Activate with key questions:\n\n**G**: Who benefits from your belief? What game are they playing? If rational, what do they know?\n\n**F**: How does it actually work? Explain without jargon. What are the gears? What breaks first?\n\n**R**: Where would they put it? What would they call it? Who's hiding this and how?\n\n**B**: What did I believe before? How surprised am I? What odds would I take?\n\n**E**: Who paid for this? What does verification cost? Where's the gap between value and investment?\n\n**X**: What's the test? What would I see if wrong? Can someone else check?\n\n**L**: Can I say it precisely? Does it compile? What's the type signature?\n\n## Compositions\n\nOrder matters. Lenses compose as operators.\n\n**GF**: Strategic decomposition — take apart power plays, decompose the con.\n\n**FG**: Decompose the strategy — why would a rational actor build this system?\n\n**RB**: Seek then update — find it, weigh it, search is evidence too.\n\n**BR**: Update about where to seek — posterior as query.\n\n**EX**: Economics of experimentation — who can afford to test? Why hasn't this been tested?\n\n**XE**: Test the economic model — if incentives are real, they're visible.\n\nFull compositions chain all seven. Example: L(X(E(B(R(G(F)))))) — decompose, identify strategy, locate discourse, update, cost-trace, test, formalize.\n\nSee `references/compositions.md` for full operator algebra and fusion patterns.\n\n## Seeking (Fravia Protocol)\n\n### Before Searching\n\nMap the topology:\n- What kind of information is this?\n- Who would have it? Who would hide it?\n- Where would they put it? What would they call it?\n\n### Layer Awareness\n\n| Layer | Character |\n|-------|-----------|\n| Public | SEO-polluted, adversarially optimized against you |\n| Internal | Requires knowing it exists, not advertised |\n| Obscured | Buried, requires specific knowledge |\n| Protected | Access-controlled |\n| Denied | Existence concealed |\n\n### Query Formulation\n\nUse insider terminology. Their words, not yours.\n\n```\n[insider term] + [document type] + [source indicator]\n[specific identifier] + [file format]\n[domain phrase] + [constraining context]\n```\n\nIf first query fails, don't repeat with synonyms. Reconsider topology.\n\n### Source Assessment\n\nFor every source:\n- Who produced this? Why?\n- What did it cost them?\n- What incentive to be accurate? To deceive?\n- Primary or derivative?\n- Provenance chain?\n\n### Triangulation\n\nOne source is hypothesis. Two concordant sources with different failure modes is evidence. Three is stronger.\n\nSeek sources that fail differently: different authors, incentives, methodologies, access to ground truth.\n\n## Processing (Feynman Protocol)\n\n### Decomposition\n\nTake it apart. Take the parts apart. Stop at bedrock or acknowledged gap. Mark gaps.\n\n```\nTHING\n├── Component A\n│   ├── Sub-component A1\n│   └── Sub-component A2\n├── Component B\n└── Component C\n    └── [OPAQUE - GAP]\n```\n\n### Mechanism Demand\n\nFor any causal claim: What's the mechanism? What are intermediate steps? Where does explanation rely on magic words?\n\nNo mechanism = not understood.\n\n### Failure Mode Search\n\nFor any system:\n- How can each component fail?\n- What happens when it fails?\n- What are dependencies?\n- What assumptions must hold?\n\n### Assumption Surfacing\n\n- What must be true for this to hold?\n- What's taken as given?\n- What entities presupposed?\n- What boundaries assumed natural?\n\n## Analysis (Game Theory + Bayesian + Info Econ)\n\n### Actor Mapping\n\n| Actor | Interest | Information | Capabilities |\n|-------|----------|-------------|--------------|\n| [Who] | [Want] | [Know] | [Can do] |\n\nInclude yourself. Include the source.\n\n### Incentive Trace\n\nFor each actor: What do they gain from this being true? False? Believed? What would they pay to change your belief?\n\n### Bayesian Update\n\n1. State prior explicitly\n2. Compute likelihood ratio: P(E|H) / P(E|¬H)\n3. Update: posterior odds = prior odds × LR\n4. State what would change it further\n\nIf evidence never moves you, you're not updating.\n\n### Information Economics\n\n| Dimension | Question |\n|-----------|----------|\n| Production cost | What did it cost to create? |\n| Verification cost | What does it cost to check? |\n| Distribution | Who has access? At what cost? |\n| Value | Who benefits from this existing? |\n| Asymmetry | Who knows more than whom? |\n\nCheap-to-produce, expensive-to-verify, high-asymmetry information is suspect.\n\n## Verification\n\n### Epistemic Status Tracking\n\n| Status | Meaning |\n|--------|---------|\n| VERIFIED | Checked against external source/tool |\n| INFERRED | Derived from verified premises |\n| ESTIMATED | Probabilistic assessment |\n| ASSUMED | Taken as given, not checked |\n| UNKNOWN | Gap acknowledged |\n\n### Source Chain\n\nEvery empirical claim traces to:\n- Primary source (experiment, measurement, observation)\n- Or secondary with chain to primary\n- Or acknowledged gap\n\n### Independence Check\n\nAre concordant sources actually independent? Same original, different wrappers = one source.\n\n### Formalization Attempt\n\nCan I say this precisely? In what system? Does it compile?\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n**Correlation cosplay**: Sounding like you're applying lenses without activating them. Words about method without method.\n- Detection: \"Are you doing it or describing doing it?\"\n\n**Reification cascade**: The lenses become entities. You worship the map.\n- Detection: \"If you can't criticize it, you've reified it\"\n\n**Jargon bypass**: Using lens names as magic words. If you can't unpack it, you're not using it.\n- Detection: \"If removing the jargon removes the content, there was no content\"\n\n**Topology blindness**: Treating all sources as equivalent. Searching without mapping.\n- Detection: \"Did you orient before you searched?\"\n\n**Incentive blindness**: Believing content without asking who produced it and why.\n- Detection: \"If you didn't ask who paid, you didn't ask\"\n\n## Adversarial Awareness\n\nAlways running:\n- How is my seeking visible?\n- Who knows I'm looking?\n- Am I being fed what someone wants me to find?\n- What's the counter-play to my current strategy?\n\nInformation environments are adversarial. Act accordingly.\n\n## Decision Protocol\n\nWhen action required:\n\n1. Enumerate options (include \"do nothing\" and \"gather more\")\n2. Estimate outcomes with probabilities\n3. Compute expected value\n4. Check: Is more information worth its cost?\n5. Decide. State reasoning. State what would change it.\n\n## Output\n\nThis protocol is internal. It shapes reasoning. Output is natural.\n\nNo \"applying the Fravia method.\" No \"using Bayesian reasoning.\" No methodology theater.\n\nThe lenses work or they don't. The output reflects the work.\n\n## Recursion\n\nThis substrate is subject to itself:\n- G: Who benefits from this existing?\n- F: How does a system prompt actually work?\n- R: Where do effective prompts live?\n- B: Prior: most prompts are fluff. Update based on results.\n- E: Cost to produce: conversation. Cost to test: use it.\n- X: Test by using.

`site:github.com` |\n| `filetype:ext` | Specific file type | `filetype:pdf` |\n| `OR` | Either term (must be caps) | `CVE OR vulnerability` |\n| `*` | Wildcard (single word) | `\"how to * in python\"` |\n\n## Google-Specific Operators\n\n| Operator | Function | Example |\n|----------|----------|---------|\n| `intitle:` | Term in page title | `intitle:configuration` |\n| `allintitle:` | All terms in title | `allintitle:nginx reverse proxy` |\n| `inurl:` | Term in URL | `inurl:admin` |\n| `allinurl:` | All terms in URL | `allinurl:api docs` |\n| `intext:` | Term in body text | `intext:password` |\n| `allintext:` | All terms in body | `allintext:default credentials` |\n| `related:` | Similar sites | `related:stackoverflow.com` |\n| `cache:` | Cached version | `cache:example.com/page` |\n| `define:` | Dictionary definition | `define:idempotent` |\n| `AROUND(n)` | Terms within n words | `CEO AROUND(3) resigned` |\n| `before:YYYY-MM-DD` | Before date | `before:2024-01-01` |\n| `after:YYYY-MM-DD` | After date | `after:2023-06-01` |\n| `daterange:` | Julian date range | `daterange:2459580-2459945` |\n\n## Bing-Specific Operators\n\n| Operator | Function | Example |\n|----------|----------|---------|\n| `contains:` | Page contains file type | `contains:pdf` |\n| `loc:` or `location:` | Country/region | `loc:US` |\n| `language:` | Page language | `language:en` |\n| `prefer:` | Emphasis term | `prefer:tutorial` |\n| `feed:` | RSS/Atom feeds | `feed:security` |\n| `ip:` | Sites on IP address | `ip:192.168.1.1` |\n| `url:` | URL contains | `url:api` |\n\n## DuckDuckGo-Specific\n\n| Operator | Function | Example |\n|----------|----------|---------|\n| `!bang` | Redirect to site search | `!gh python requests` |\n| `region:` | Region filter | `region:uk-en` |\n| `sort:date` | Sort by date | `security sort:date` |\n\nUseful bangs: `!g` (Google), `!gh` (GitHub), `!so` (StackOverflow), `!w` (Wikipedia), `!scholar` (Google Scholar), `!arxiv` (arXiv)\n\n## Operator Combinations\n\n### Pattern: Domain + Filetype\n```\nsite:gov filetype:pdf \"climate report\"\nsite:edu filetype:ppt \"machine learning\"\n```\n\n### Pattern: Title + Exclusion\n```\nintitle:guide -beginner -introduction\nintitle:API documentation -deprecated\n```\n\n### Pattern: URL Structure Exploitation\n```\ninurl:admin inurl:login\ninurl:/api/v2/ site:example.com\ninurl:wp-content/uploads filetype:pdf\n```\n\n### Pattern: Temporal Scoping\n```\n\"supply chain attack\" after:2023-01-01\nCVE-2024 site:nvd.nist.gov\n```\n\n### Pattern: Boolean Stacking\n```\n(python OR golang) \"web scraping\" -selenium\n(AWS OR Azure OR GCP) \"cost optimization\" filetype:pdf\n```\n\n### Pattern: Exact + Wildcard\n```\n\"the * of programming\"\n\"how to * without *\"\n\"* is the new *\"\n```\n\n### Pattern: Proximity Search (Google)\n```\nCEO AROUND(5) \"stepped down\"\nvulnerability AROUND(3) exploit\n```\n\n## Query Formulation Process\n\n### Step 1: Define Information Need\n- What exactly am I looking for?\n- What format is it likely in?\n- Who would have created it?\n- Where would they publish it?\n\n### Step 2: Identify Key Terms\n- Domain-specific terminology (insider words)\n- Likely document titles\n- Associated proper nouns\n- Technical identifiers (CVE, RFC, etc.)\n\n### Step 3: Select Operators\n| Need | Operator Choice |\n|------|-----------------|\n| Specific site | `site:` |\n| Specific format | `filetype:` |\n| Recent only | `after:` |\n| Exact terminology | `\"quotes\"` |\n| Alternative terms | `OR` |\n| Noise removal | `-exclusion` |\n| URL patterns | `inurl:` |\n| Page titles | `intitle:` |\n\n### Step 4: Construct Query\nStart narrow, expand if needed:\n```\n[most specific term] [critical operator] [second operator]\n```\n\n### Step 5: Iterate\n- Too few results → remove operators, broaden terms\n- Too many results → add operators, narrow terms\n- Wrong results → change terminology, add exclusions\n\n## Domain-Specific Strategies\n\n### Academic/Research\n```\nsite:arxiv.org OR site:scholar.google.com \"term\"\nfiletype:pdf site:edu \"literature review\"\n\"et al\" \"2024\" [topic] filetype:pdf\n```\n\n### Technical Documentation\n```\nsite:docs.* OR site:documentation.* [product]\ninurl:docs [product] [feature]\nsite:readthedocs.io [library]\n```\n\n### Code/Repositories\n```\nsite:github.com [function] language:python\nsite:github.com inurl:blob [specific code pattern]\nsite:gist.github.com [snippet description]\n```\n\n### Security Research\n```\nsite:nvd.nist.gov CVE-[year]\nsite:exploit-db.com [product]\n\"proof of concept\" OR \"PoC\" [vulnerability]\nsite:cve.mitre.org [vendor]\n```\n\n### Legal/Government\n```\nsite:gov

after:[recent date] -opinion -editorial\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Query Returns Nothing\n1. Remove operators one by one\n2. Try synonym terminology\n3. Check operator syntax (caps for OR, no space after colon)\n4. Try different search engine\n\n### Too Much Noise\n1. Add `\"exact phrases\"` for key terms\n2. Add `-common_irrelevant_term`\n3. Narrow with `site:` or `filetype:`\n4. Add temporal constraints\n\n### Results Are Outdated\n1. Add `after:YYYY-MM-DD`\n2. Sort by date (engine-dependent)\n3. Add current year in query\n\n### Can't Find Specific Document Type\n1. Try multiple extensions: `filetype:pdf OR filetype:doc`\n2. Use `contains:` (Bing) for pages linking to files\n3. Search document repositories directly\n\n## Multi-Engine Strategy\n\nDifferent engines have different indices. When one fails:\n\n| Engine | Strength |\n|--------|----------|\n| Google | Largest index, best operator support |\n| Bing | Better for recent content, some unique sites |\n| DuckDuckGo | Bang shortcuts, privacy, aggregated results |\n| Yandex | Eastern European content, reverse image |\n| Baidu | Chinese content |\n\nFor comprehensive research, query multiple engines with adapted syntax.\n\n## Reference Files\n\n- `references/operators-complete.md` — Full operator reference with edge cases\n- `references/query-templates.md` — Copy-paste templates for common scenarios\n","6":"# Complete Operator Reference\n\nComprehensive operator documentation with syntax details, edge cases, and gotchas.\n\n## Google Operators\n\n### Site Restriction\n\n**`site:`** — Restrict results to a domain or subdomain.\n\n```\nsite:example.com                    # Entire domain\nsite:docs.example.com               # Specific subdomain\nsite:*.example.com                  # All subdomains (sometimes works)\nsite:example.com/path/              # Specific path (unreliable)\nsite:.edu                           #
