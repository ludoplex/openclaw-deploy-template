## Afternoon: Mixpost Deployment Revisited

**Issue Discovered:** Duplicate `mixpost_entities` table conflict

When deploying the Laravel host app (`C:\dev\mixpost-app`), ran into:
```
SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1 table "mixpost_entities" already exists
```

**Root Cause:** The main `create_mixpost_tables.php` migration in mixpost-malone **already creates** the `mixpost_entities` table. Our separate `2026_02_03_000001_create_entities_table.php` migration is redundant for fresh installs.

**Resolution Options:**
1. **Delete the separate migration** - rely on the main mixpost migration for entities table
2. **Convert to additive migration** - only add columns/indexes if table exists, skip creation
3. **Guard with Schema::hasTable()** - wrap creation in conditional

**Recommended:** Option 1 - delete `database/migrations/2026_02_03_000001_create_entities_table.php` since entity support was merged into main mixpost migrations during the feature development.

**Current State:**
- Main mixpost tables: ✅ created
- Entity tables: ✅ already created by main migration
- Host app: `C:\dev\mixpost-app` ready
- Docker pattern: `docker run --rm -v "C:\dev\mixpost-app:/app" -v "C:\dev\mixpost-malone:/packages/mixpost-malone" -w /app php:8.4-cli`

**To Resume:**
1. Delete redundant entity migration from `C:\dev\mixpost-app\database\migrations\`
2. Clear failed migration batch: `php artisan migrate:rollback` or manually fix `migrations` table
3. Continue with `php artisan migrate`
4. Build assets and start server
