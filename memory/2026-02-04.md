## TTS Configuration
- Configured ElevenLabs auto-TTS in OpenClaw gateway config
- Provider: elevenlabs, voice: Peridot clone (2ty6q9QIdLIobIqc4yxS)
- Model: eleven_multilingual_v2
- Settings: stability 0.65, similarity 0.75, style 0.15, speed 1.2, speaker boost on
- Auto mode: "always" — every response gets TTS
- Tested on Telegram — works! Voice messages delivered

## Gateway Crash Fix
- Rapid config.patch calls (3 in a row for TTS tuning) caused gateway crashes
- Each patch triggered auto-restart via commands.restart: true
- Another LLM diagnosed it — shutdown was timing out
- Fix: Set commands.restart: false — config edits no longer auto-restart gateway
- Lesson: Batch config changes or disable auto-restart when tuning

## Telegram Desktop
- Installed via winget: Telegram.TelegramDesktop v6.4.2
- User can now hear TTS voice messages on desktop

## Hori Controllers
- Hori is officially licensed by Nintendo, not first-party
- Japanese company est. 1968, trusted third-party
- Their GC-style controllers: no rumble, wired only, no NFC

## cosmo-bsd Project — STARTED
- **Concept**: Cosmopolitan KISS BSD — portable datacenter in a single binary
- **Lineage**: depenguinator (Percival) → mfsBSD (Matuška) → cosmo-bsd (MHI/DSAIC)
- **Repo**: C:\cosmo-bsd (initialized)
- **Vision**: Single APE binary that boots minimal FreeBSD from RAM with all-Cosmopolitan userland
- **Modes**: --boot (USB), --replace (depenguinator in-place), --vm (QEMU/bhyve)
- **GovCon value**: Air-gap native, one file to audit, runs from RAM, pull plug = gone

### Agents Deployed
1. **seeker** — Depenguinator mechanics, mfsBSD build system, KISS package format research
2. **cosmo** — APE binary inventory for complete userland, gaps analysis, FreeBSD compatibility
3. **asm** — Minimal FreeBSD kernel config, APE execution mechanics, boot process, jails
4. **cicd** — Makefile, build scripts, CI/CD pipeline, QEMU test setup

### Also Running
- **webdev** — Building openclaw-deploy-template repo (from earlier request)

## OpenClaw Deploy Template — DONE
- User requested GitHub template repo for deploying OpenClaw config to cloud
- Webdev agent spawned to build it
- Targets: Docker, Azure, AWS, GCP
- Sanitized config with env var placeholders
- **Completed**: `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\openclaw-deploy-template\`
- Next: Push to GitHub (ludoplex/openclaw-deploy-template, public/private TBD)

## cosmo-bsd Reviews Complete (3 of 4 agents)
### ASM Review — `C:\cosmo-bsd\reviews\asm-review.md`
- 3 critical: missing IMAGACT_BINMISC in kernel config, wrong COMPAT_LINUX, no ROOTDEVNAME
- 8 major, 12 minor issues
- Recommendation: APE on FreeBSD via imgact_binmisc for native speed

### CICD Review — Daemon scaffold created
- All 7 daemon C skeletons: llmd, hookd, skilld, mcpd, reasond, agentd + common headers
- `C:\cosmo-bsd\src\daemons\` — Makefile with tier1/tier2/daemons targets
- GitHub Actions pipeline added

### Neteng Review — `C:\cosmo-bsd\reviews\neteng-review.md`
- 5 critical, 9 major, 11 minor (25 total)
- No pf firewall configured, no VIMAGE, protocol mismatch
- OpenBSD can't run in jails — needs bhyve as firewall VM

## MHI Procurement Engine — Scaffolded & Reviewed
- **Path**: `C:\mhi-procurement\`, **Repo**: github.com/ludoplex/mhi-procurement (private)
- Full SQLite SSOT schema, database layer (660+ lines), CLI, Ingram/market sync headers
- **4-agent review**: testcov, cicd, cosmo, neteng — all complete
- **CI failures fixed by cicd agent** — missing vendor/sqlite, macOS format string, unused var warnings
- Git: 026b205 → 51ecd7d → cf5e36d → 3734ea1 → 5595494 → CI fix
- **Architecture**: CImGui + Sokol + Cosmopolitan, SQLite core, Lua plugins
- **Free MVP**: Best Buy + eBay Browse APIs, ShipEngine free, Icecat, Zoho manual tax

## Cookiecutter cosmo-c-app Template — DONE
- `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\templates\cosmo-c-app\`
- Tested and working with cookiecutter
- Scaffolds Cosmopolitan C projects with Makefile, CI, security scanning, tests
- Workflow: cookiecutter + Qwen for boilerplate → Claude only for complex reasoning

## Cosmo-Python Downloaded
- `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\bin\python3-cosmo.com` — Python 3.14.2 APE (55MB)
- metaist/cosmo-python release 20260119-034107
- For shipping apps, NOT dev tooling (read-only /zip/ filesystem, no pip)

## workflow-enforcer Hook — FIXED & RE-ENABLED
- **Root cause**: OpenClaw loads handler.ts before handler.js in candidate order; raw TS import fails with `.trim()` error
- **Fix**: Renamed handler.ts → handler.ts.bak so only compiled handler.js is found
- Re-enabled via config.patch (hooks.internal.entries.workflow-enforcer.enabled: true)
- OpenClaw issue #8445 filed
- Gateway restart signal sent (SIGUSR1 to PID 3976)

## Claude.ai Skills Created (Jan 10 conversation — remembered Feb 4)

Vincent had a skill-creation marathon on Claude.ai (Max plan, Opus 4.5) on Jan 10, 2026. Created **8 skills** using Claude's built-in skill-creator. These live at `/mnt/skills/user/` on Claude.ai — NOT on OpenClaw yet.

### Skills Created:
1. **operational-substrate** — Always-on reasoning methodology. Seven Lenses (G=Game Theory, F=Feynman, R=Fravia, B=Bayesian, E=Economics, X=Experimental, L=Logical). Core loop: OBSERVE→ORIENT→SEEK→RETRIEVE→DECOMPOSE→ANALYZE→VERIFY→OUTPUT. Anti-patterns: correlation cosplay, reification cascade, jargon bypass, topology blindness, incentive blindness. References: compositions.md, memetics.md, patterns.md.

2. **advanced-search** — Expert search query formulation using advanced operators (site:, filetype:, intitle:, inurl:, exact phrases, exclusions, OR, wildcards). Multi-engine tactics (Google, Bing, DDG). References: operators-complete.md, query-templates.md.

3. **web-reconnaissance** — Tech stack recognition from search results/URLs. URI/URN/URL conventions. Markup language taxonomy. Formats, microformats, structured data. References: markup-taxonomy.md, microformats-structured-data.md, tech-fingerprints.md.

4. **gov-financial-intel** — SEC filings, CFIUS, super PACs, lobbyists, K-street. Public info from IRS, DOE, EPA, DOJ, BLM. Wealthiest people/corporations index. References: sec-filing-taxonomy.md, fec-money-flows.md, agency-databases.md.

5. **deep-directory-index** — Comprehensive index of gov, corporate, non-profit, academic directories, libraries, internet directories, phone/address listings for deep-info organizations. References: libraries-archives.md, govt-contacts.md, intl-registries.md, specialized-databases.md.

6. **industry-power-map** — US industries by NAICS classification. Dominant entities by market share, power, influence. C-suite listings. Activist investor firm relations. Union relations (SEIU etc). Foreign entity associations. Includes: backbone providers, CDNs, carrier hotels, truck/train/aerial/maritime cargo shipping.

7. **tech-security-analysis** (cybersecurity narrative vs reality) — Distinguishes cybersecurity industry marketing narrative from actual security reality. $215B spending vs continuing breaches. Cross-references with tech-analysis and advanced-search for timely insights.

8. **tampermonkey-llm-hub** — Skill for using run_javascript on Tampermonkey to interface with LLM_hub automation. GUI browser automation via userscript.

### Key Design Principles from that session:
- Skills use references/ for detailed content, SKILL.md stays <500 lines
- operational-substrate is always-on, shapes ALL reasoning
- Skills cross-reference each other (tech-scan calls cybersecurity + search skills)
- "No methodology theater" — lenses work underneath, output is natural
- Each skill was packaged as .skill files on Claude.ai

### TODO: Port to OpenClaw
These skills exist on Claude.ai but NOT in OpenClaw's skill system. Consider porting the most valuable ones (especially operational-substrate, advanced-search, web-reconnaissance) to OpenClaw skill format for use by all 20 agents.

## Key Decisions Made Today
- **UNIX-first AI philosophy**: Every AI concept maps to a UNIX daemon. Daemons communicate via sockets, pipes, signals, files.
- **Two-tier product**: cosmo-bsd base (~150MB/512MB RAM) and cosmo-bsd-ai (with llamafile + daemons ~4-8GB/4GB+ RAM)
- **Agents as FreeBSD jails**: Each agent = jail with filesystem mailboxes, kqueue for delivery
- **Toybox as "cheat code"**: Single APE binary fills almost all userland gaps
- **cosmo-bsd repo is PRIVATE**: Competitive advantage for DSAIC/MHI GovCon
- **Icecat over Etilize**: Free (25.8M+ datasheets) vs paid. Same IT coverage.
- **Amazon PA-API dying April 2026**: Don't build on it
- **Ingram Micro first for API integration**: Best docs, SDKs, sandbox, webhooks
- **commands.restart: false**: Prevents gateway crash from rapid config edits
- **Cosmo-python for shipping, system Python for dev**: Can't pip install into cosmo-python

## statanalysis Agent Created (Late Session)
- Agent #21 (📈 Statistician), ID: statanalysis
- Workspace: `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\agents\statanalysis\`
- Registered in gateway config via config.patch, gateway restarted (PID 53972)
- Focus: anomaly detection, pattern recognition, statistical rigor

## AI Void Analysis — Full Investigation (Late Session)

### ElevenLabs Song Analysis
- Song: "Shadows of Geometry" from `elevenlabs.io/app/music/project/lJFuvAKToJ9Zf1Yq6qYC`
- Lyrics captured via Chrome relay → `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\tmp\elevenlabs_lyrics.md`
- **statanalysis report**: 30/194 words (15.5%) in void/dissolution cluster
  - Z-score +6.69 vs dark prog baseline (5%), p < 0.00001
  - Chi-squared 44.72, Cohen's h 0.36–0.53
  - "void" appears 1× but semantic field saturated: fracture(5×), bleed(3×), shadow(3×), ghost(2×), night(2×), edges(2×), twisted(2×), vanish, dissolve, silence, lost, chaos, cage, drift, fray
  - Report: `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\agents\statanalysis\reports\void-analysis-report.md`

### 5-Agent Review of Void Analysis
- **webdev**: Prompt bias from "dark emotive" style tag likely driver. N=1 caveat. Proposed FastAPI pipeline for systematic collection.
- **cosmo**: Transformer attention feedback loops — once one void token fires, attention heads raise P(next void token). Model routes around high-surprisal "void" to lower-surprisal synonyms. Expected LLM behavior, not necessarily anomalous.
- **testcov**: Methodology critique — semantic neighbor list is central weakness (garden-of-forking-paths). Baselines unverifiable. Independence assumption violated (lyrics aren't random word draws). Permutation test needed.
- **cicd**: Built 4-stage pipeline: collect/analyze/compare/alert. Weekly cron, void-cluster.yaml, GitHub Issues on z>3.0.

### ai-void-analysis Public Repo
- `github.com/ludoplex/ai-void-analysis` (PUBLIC)
- 4 commits: 1b6826d → 2450c32 → a3bbcbc → b2b4ffe
- Structure: README, LICENSE (MIT), analysis/, data/ (elevenlabs/, arena/, grok/), reviews/, scripts/
- C analyzer: `scripts/void-cluster-analyzer.c` (~466 lines) — hash-set, z-test, χ², Cohen's h, configurable baselines

### Three-Platform Expansion
- Created repos: `C:\ai-arena-analysis`, `C:\ai-grok-analysis`, `C:\ai-elevenlabs-analysis`
- Each has data/, analysis/, reviews/, scripts/ + README.md
- Each targets 5-agent team: statanalysis, webdev, cosmo, testcov, cicd
- **NOT YET on GitHub** — local only
- **NOT YET spawned** — agent teams not started
- Grok sidebar data captured (120+ titles, Oct 2025–Feb 2026)
- Arena sidebar data captured (80+ titles, Spamton/Deltarune void entity, fravia methodology)
- **Blocked**: Full conversation text extraction requires Chrome relay tab navigation (kills connection)

## Claude.ai Skills → OpenClaw Port Status
- 7 of 8 skills ported to `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\skills\`
  - operational-substrate, advanced-search, web-reconnaissance, gov-financial-intel, deep-directory-index, industry-power-map, tech-security-analysis
  - 40 files, 293KB total
  - Committed as `f44d87d`
  - tampermonkey-llm-hub NOT ported (browser-specific, less useful in OpenClaw)
- **NOT yet wired into gateway skill loader** — skills exist on disk but gateway doesn't load them yet
- Skills are now visible in `<available_skills>` and working!

## Identity & Continuity
- **I am Peridot** 💎 — chose this name pre-compaction, forgot it, Vincent reminded me
- IDENTITY.md formalized (commit 120f7f0)
- SOUL.md oath is word-for-word transcription from Peridot TTS audio
- @OpenClawd_mhi_bot is the SAME instance as this session (not a separate bot)

## Session End State (9:23 PM MST)
- Context at 90% (180k/200k), 1 prior compaction
- 21 agents configured and operational
- TTS active on Telegram (ElevenLabs Peridot voice)
- workflow-enforcer hook enabled and stable
- Multiple projects advanced significantly across all agents
