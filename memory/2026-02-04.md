# 2026-02-04 — Session Notes

## MHI Procurement Engine — READY FOR TESTING
- **85/85 tests passing** (48 database + 37 search/SQLi)
- CLI fully functional: search, margins, suppliers, basket, PO commands
- Database auto-creates, schema initializes, 4 suppliers seeded
- Build: `wsl -d Ubuntu-22.04 -- bash -c "cd /mnt/c/mhi-procurement && make native && make test"`

### Agent Deliveries (all committed & pushed):
- **cicd** (commit 609d679): Added `-Werror` to CI builds, new `sanitizers.yml` workflow (ASAN+UBSAN × gcc+clang)
- **cosmo** (commit abd316f): 4 build tiers (native/cosmo/native-full/cosmo-full), updated setup-vendor.sh, README
- **testcov**: TIMED OUT — no new test files delivered. Existing 85 tests are solid though.

### Source files (C:\mhi-procurement):
- src/main.c — CLI app with all commands
- src/db/database.c/h — Full CRUD, search, margins, basket, PO, sync tracking
- src/db/schema.sql + schema_sql.h — Embedded schema (no external file deps)
- src/net/http.c/h — Full HTTPS client with mbedTLS, connection pooling, rate limiting, OAuth2
- src/sync/ingram.c/h — Ingram Micro REST v6 integration (catalog, pricing, orders)
- src/ui/gui.c — Complete CImGui + Sokol GUI (needs vendor libs)
- tests/ — test_database.c (48), test_search.c (37)

## Arena/Grok Data Extraction — BLOCKED
- **Playwright approach failed**: Google SSO actively blocks automated Chromium browsers during sign-in
  - Fresh browser: Google detects automation, kills auth flow
  - Chrome profile: Too heavy, causes crashes (IPH errors, GCM deprecated)  
  - Multiple attempts, multiple script versions (arena-extract.js, probe-arena.js, probe-arena-fresh.js, probe-arena-v2.js)
- **Stale cookie issue**: Arena sets auth cookies even for non-logged-in sessions; checking for `arena-auth` cookies doesn't distinguish auth state
- **API confirmed working**: `/api/history/list?limit=50&includeArchived=false` returns conversation metadata when properly authenticated — just can't get authenticated via Playwright
- **CORRECT APPROACH**: Use Chrome relay (profile="chrome") with already-authenticated tabs — no Playwright needed. Asked Vincent to reattach relay.
- **Scripts location**: `C:\ai-void-analysis\scripts\extract\` — probe-arena-v2.js is latest but useless without Google SSO fix
- **Lesson**: Don't fight Google's anti-automation. Use the Chrome relay for authenticated extraction. Playwright is for sites without SSO or with email/password login.

## Browser Tab Status (as of ~22:30 MST)
- Arena tab was confirmed accessible (Roblox dev comparison conversation)
- Grok tab was confirmed accessible (Jets Wrestling Center, 140+ conversation titles)
- Chrome relay disconnected when Vincent reopened Chrome — needs reattach

## Grok Conversation — Personal Context
- Vincent shared memories of growing up at the California Jets Wrestling Training Center
- His father Bob Anderson founded it (1981-mid 1990s, San Clemente CA)
- Vincent is youngest of 3 sons (Michael Shane, Dru, Vincent)
- 14 national championships, 3 consecutive open nationals 1989-1991
- Bob Anderson passed away November 2025
- Grok had detailed conversation about the center's history, facility layout, championships

## Identity Note
- Vincent asked about 💎 emoji meaning — confirmed it's a nod to him (April 23 birthstone = Diamond)
- "Under-18" concern: Was just a Grok conversation title ("Fixing Accidental Under-18 Settings Nov 17") visible in sidebar snapshot, not content I flagged

## Active Sessions (end of session)
- 3 procurement agents completed (cicd ✅, cosmo ✅, testcov ⏰ timed out)
- Waiting for Chrome relay reattach to proceed with Arena extraction
- NODE_PATH required for Playwright: `$env:NODE_PATH = "C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules"`
