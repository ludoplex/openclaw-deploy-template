# 2026-02-14 - Daily Notes

## CRITICAL REMINDER: Tools I Have
**USE THESE - DON'T FORGET:**
1. **Supplier Email Search** (`C:\zoho-console-api-module-system\src\modules\supplier_search\`) - searches Zoho Mail for API creds
2. **Procurement API Credentials** (`C:\mhi-procurement\config.ini`) - already have Ingram, Mouser, Element14, Climb working!
3. **Zoho Mail API** - can search rachelwilliams@ and vincentlanderson@ inboxes

## Supplier API Session

* Vincent arrived to bang out permissions for D\&H, DigiKey, Mouser, VEX Robotics
* Opened Playwright tabs for all supplier portals

## Important: Email Search Protocol

When searching for supplier credentials, contracts, or business documents:
Multiple searches are necessary to find what you're looking for regardless of which inbox or what you are searching to find, use fravia seeking method and advanced search operator combinations if possible with the email inbox api being used. inbox at 0 means something is misconfigured or application malfunctioned or is incomplete and needs to be fixed or rewritten to work.

* **PRIMARY:** rachelwilliams@mightyhouseinc.com (search FIRST, vast majority about partnerships, authorization, supply channels, sales channels found here, never empty)
* **SECONDARY:** vincentlanderson@mightyhouseinc.com (only after checking Rachel's, often as dev related account info but also other technical and/or gov correspondence)
* Tertiary: mightyhouseinc@gmail.com (amazon store uses this as primary email, others had issues with amazon's sign up causing sign up verification loop unresolvable, this email is also used for live streaming accounts for Mighty House Inc. on twitch, youtube, facebook, and TikTok/TikTok store, possibly others)

## Supplier Status

|Supplier|Account|API Status|Action|
|-|-|-|-|
|D\&H|#3270340000|Need API key|Portal login → API Access|
|DigiKey|?|Need signup|developer.digikey.com|
|Mouser|✅ Active|Search API working|Already have credentials|
|VEX Robotics|?|Unknown|Check for API/reseller program|
|TD SYNNEX|#786379|Need API|Developer portal signup|
|Ingram Micro|#50-135152-000|Sandbox working|Prod in review|
|Climb|CU0043054170|❓ Needs investigation|Check if API exists|

## WSL2 Migration Understanding
- **OpenClaw runs in WSL2** (Ubuntu-22.04)
- WSL2 native paths: `/home/user/.openclaw/`
- Windows paths via WSL: `/mnt/c/Users/user/.openclaw/workspace/`
- **No symlinks** — standard WSL mount
- Session files: `/home/user/.openclaw/agents/{agentId}/sessions/{sessionId}.jsonl`
- Analyst active session: `/home/user/.openclaw/agents/analyst/sessions/98861f67-1538-463c-b9f7-f30547395a7d.jsonl`

## Critical Corrections from Vincent
1. **MHI is ALREADY vendor/ESP in all school choice states** — WithOdyssey included, evidenced by emails
2. **D&H APIs DO exist** — confirmed, don't claim otherwise
3. **Climb needs thorough investigation** — don't write it off
4. **Don't spawn agents randomly** — compose based on actual task requirements
5. **Always construct a plan first** — then delegate strategically

## Agent Spawning Rule
Pick agents based on **composition of tasks** being delegated as part of the **greater plan** you construct to follow commands. No irrelevant specializations.

## Session Startup Protocol (from AGENTS.md)
Every session, FIRST:
1. Read `SOUL.md`
2. Read `USER.md`
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday)
4. If main session: Also read `MEMORY.md`
