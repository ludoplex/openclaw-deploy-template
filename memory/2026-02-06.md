# Memory: February 6, 2026

## Session Summary
Major strategic planning session focused on GUNDOM market positioning and multi-entity SOP automation deep dive.

## GUNDOM Project

### Market Analysis Completed
- **Analyst agent** produced comprehensive 3-year revenue trajectory:
  - Year 1: $275K (foundation)
  - Year 2: $850K (growth)
  - Year 3: $1.95M (scale)
- Revenue hierarchy established: **Gov/LE ($$$) > Sports ($) > Hunting (volume)**
- Key differentiator: EDWOSB sole-source up to $7M + true white-label (Applied Ballistics requires co-branding)

### Events Strategy (CRITICAL)
- **NRA 2026**: April 16-19, Houston TX, George R. Brown Convention Center — **~10 weeks out**
- **SHOT Show 2026**: MISSED (was January) — must book 2027 NOW
- **GAP Grind**: Also April timeframe, precision rifle event
- **Investment Tiers**: Minimal $25-50K, Moderate $75-150K, Aggressive $200-400K, Dominant $500K+

### Files Created
- `memory/gundom-market-segments.md` — Ballistics agent's segment requirements
- `memory/gundom-events-calendar.md` — Events presence strategy
- `memory/gundom-gtm-strategy.md` — Analyst's GTM strategy (in progress)
- `memory/gundom-market-analysis.md` — Full market analysis (to be saved)

### Commission Context
GUNDOM commissioned by WY Rep. Jeremy Haroldson for Old Glory Firearms. Political/GovCon connection is strategic asset.

## SOP Automation Deep Review

### System Scope
- **13 SOPs** across three entities (MHI, DSAIC, Computer Store)
- **14 Zoho modules** integrated
- Engine location: `C:\zoho-console-api-module-system\src\modules\sop\engine.py` (~450 lines)

### Key SOP: Student-to-Employee Pipeline
Cross-entity SOP that feeds certified Computer Store students to MHI/DSAIC hiring — identified as **key strategic moat**.

## Entity Website Priority
1. **MHI first** — GovCon credibility urgent
2. **DSAIC second** — blocked on domain (recommend dsaicorp.com, NOT .ai per Vincent)
3. **Computer Store third** — subdomain of MHI

## Agent Fleet Activity
Spawned and briefed 7 agents for specialized work:
- **seeker** — Advanced search methodology
- **analyst** — Market analysis, competitive research
- **ballistics** — GUNDOM SME (advisory only)
- **webdev** — SOP Dashboard development
- **sitecraft** — Entity websites
- **cosmo** — Cosmopolitan/APE work
- **asm** — Assembly optimization

## Technical Notes

### Tool Issue
`memory_search` broken — returns "missing tool result in session history" error. Workaround: use grep/ripgrep directly.

### Research Methodology
Established workflow: headless browser + advanced search operators + documentation for inter-assistant discussions. All discussions must be persisted to local files or Google Drive.

## Next Actions (Pending)
1. Check NRA 2026 exhibitor booth availability/costs (deadline likely imminent)
2. Book SHOT Show 2027 booth registration
3. Have webdev start SOP Dashboard scaffolding (FastAPI+HTMX, target Feb 7)
4. Confirm DSAIC domain choice with Vincent
5. Implement headless browser research workflow for agents
