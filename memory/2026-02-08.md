## Major Accomplishments

### LLM Export Scripts Created
Built export scripts for all major LLM platforms:
- `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\scripts\chatgpt-export.py`
- `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\scripts\claude-export.py`
- `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\scripts\perplexity-export.py`
- `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\scripts\grok-export.py`
- `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\scripts\arena-export.py`

### Web Automation System
Built comprehensive Playwright-based automation at `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\automation\`:
- `playwright-automator.py` — Core engine with persistent browser state
- `mhi-automator.py` — Full automation for logins, signups, forms
- `entity-profiles.json` — MHI/DSAIC/Computer Store data
- `signup-templates.json` — URLs for distributors/vendors/platforms

### Advisory Triad Verdict
Ran proper sequential triad (redundancy → critic → solver):
- **Result:** CONDITIONAL GO — severely reduced scope
- **Recommendation:** Manual registration + documentation beats fragile automation
- 44 hours manual vs 75+ hours automation
- Don't build: automated portal submissions, supplier handlers, scrapers
- Do build: Bitwarden migration, encrypted profiles, documentation

Files:
- `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\automation\redundancy-check.md`
- `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\automation\critic-sequential.md`
- `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\automation\solutions-final.md`

### MHI Business Info Discovered
Added to entity profiles:
- **Phone:** (307) 331-1040
- **DUNS:** 081351838
- **CAGE:** 8DFL3
- **UEI:** NA1ZBSQTJ468
- Still missing: EIN (check IRS correspondence)

### Master Account Inventory
127 accounts found across 4 entities, 18 categories:
- `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\automation\master-account-inventory.json`
- Includes: 24 suppliers, 15 financial, 14 social, 12 e-commerce, 6 gaming

### Social Media Accounts
21 accounts (13 social, 5 marketing, 3 discovery):
- `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\automation\social-media-accounts.json`

## Process Learnings

### Advisory Triad Must Be Sequential
User corrected me: spawn redundancy checker first, wait for completion, THEN spawn critic with that output, THEN spawn solver with both outputs. NOT parallel.

### Full File Paths Always
Added to AGENTS.md: Always use full paths in discourse.
- ❌ `automation/file.json`
- ✅ `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\automation\file.json`

### Playwright > Selenium
Playwright with persistent context is most reliable for repeated web automation:
- Auto-waits, no chromedriver issues, state persists between sessions
- Browser state at `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\automation\browser-state\`

## Blockers

### Gmail/Drive Access
Playwright browser not logged into Gmail/Google Drive. User needs to:
1. Run `python C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\automation\playwright-automator.py`
2. Navigate to Gmail, login once
3. Session persists for future runs

### Zoho API Rate Limits
Heavy rate limiting (HTTP 500/404) on email searches. Work around by batching/caching.

## System Changes
- Brave browser uninstalled
- Hindsight + Foresight agents queued in `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\automation\PENDING-AGENTS.md`

## GPU Server (Wednesday Feb 12)
- Specs confirmed: Threadripper, 256GB RAM, 4x V100 32GB
- Checklist at `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\gpu-server-setup-checklist.md`
- Check for transport damage on PCIe slots/heatsink
