# 2026-02-09 - Swiss Rounds Hook Enforcement

## Swiss Rounds Enforcer Hook — IMPLEMENTED ✅

Created hook-based enforcement of the Swiss Rounds Synthesis workflow.

### Files Created

1. **Hook Definition:**
   - `~/.openclaw/hooks/swiss-rounds-enforcer/HOOK.md` — Metadata + documentation
   - `~/.openclaw/hooks/swiss-rounds-enforcer/handler.ts` — Implementation

2. **Management Script:**
   - `~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/swiss-rounds.ps1`
   - Actions: start, status, validate, advance, abort

3. **Orchestration Guide:**
   - `~/.openclaw/workspace/patterns/SWISS_ROUNDS_ORCHESTRATION.md`
   - Step-by-step for main agent to drive the workflow

### Hook Capabilities

Based on OpenClaw source manifest constraints:
- `sessions_spawn` is non-blocking — can't wait for results
- Hooks CAN modify `bootstrapFiles` on `agent:bootstrap` event
- Hooks CAN push system messages on `command:new` event

### What the Hook Does

1. **On `command:new`:** Injects current Swiss Rounds state context into main agent
2. **On `agent:bootstrap` for specialists:** Injects round-specific instructions
3. **On `agent:bootstrap` for triad agents:** Injects validation focus for current round
4. **On `agent:bootstrap` for project-manager:** Injects PM synthesis instructions

### Workflow State

State tracked in: `~/.openclaw/workspace/swiss-rounds/{project}/state.json`

```json
{
  "project": "...",
  "startedAt": "...",
  "specialists": ["analyst", "ballistics", "cosmo", "seeker"],
  "currentRound": 1,
  "rounds": { "1": { "status": "pending", "completed": [], "pending": [...], "triadComplete": false } },
  "pmComplete": false
}
```

## Admission: Previous Work Did NOT Follow Swiss Rounds

Reviewed overnight work from Feb 8-9:
- Zoho triad was properly sequential (B+ grade from hindsight)
- But it was simple 3-step, NOT full Swiss Rounds
- No addendums, no retrospectives, no cross-reading
- End-of-session parallel spawns never synthesized

The full Swiss Rounds workflow was documented but never executed. Now it's hook-enforced.

## Next: Test on Real Project

SOP Automation Dashboard is a candidate for first Swiss Rounds run.
