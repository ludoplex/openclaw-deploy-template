# Memory Log — 2026-02-09

## MHI Procurement App — Critical Session

### Decision Made
- **Extend C codebase** (not TypeScript greenfield)
- **D&H + TD SYNNEX first**, Ingram already done
- Deadline: **Noon 2026-02-10**

### Files Created Tonight
```
C:\mhi-procurement\src\sync\dandh.c     (18KB) — D&H REST API, API key auth
C:\mhi-procurement\src\sync\dandh.h
C:\mhi-procurement\src\sync\synnex.c    (21KB) — TD SYNNEX API, OAuth2 auth  
C:\mhi-procurement\src\sync\synnex.h
```
- Committed: `2e2eeb2` — "Add D&H and TD SYNNEX API integrations"
- Both follow ingram.c pattern exactly

### Source Manifest Created
- `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\manifests\mhi-procurement-source-manifest.md`
- 103 functions documented with name, signature, file, line, purpose

### Hooks Wired Up
Added 4 missing hooks to openclaw.json:
- `build-verify` — Check broken links after build
- `change-journal` — Log infra changes with rollback
- `localsearch-enforcer` — Enforce localsearch-first rhythm
- `manifest-enforcer` — Inject manifest methodology

### Critical Lesson: The Rhythm
Vincent taught the correct agent spawn pattern:
```
localsearch → seeker → specialist
localsearch → seeker
localsearch → spawn triad
localsearch → seeker
localsearch → spawn pm
```
**localsearch is the anchor** — runs before EVERY phase to ground everyone in what exists locally.

I was spawning seeker in parallel when it should be DEPENDENT on localsearch results. This wasted tokens researching things we already had.

### Active Accounts (Already Have Access)
- Ingram Micro: #50-135152-000 ✅ WORKING
- TD SYNNEX: #786379 ✅ ACTIVE
- D&H: #3270340000 ✅ ACTIVE
- Climb: #CU0043054170 (no API)

### cosmo-sokol v3 Deliberation — BLOCKED
- Rounds 1-3 specialists + triads + PM synthesis complete
- Decision pending: **Staged Partial Sync** vs **Permanent Fork**
- All reports at: `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\swiss-rounds\cosmo-sokol-v3\`
- Awaiting Vincent's decision before proceeding

### Next Steps for Tomorrow Morning
1. Test build: `make cosmo-full`
2. Validate D&H API with real credentials
3. Validate SYNNEX API with real credentials
4. Wire up multi-supplier search in GUI
5. Add entity switching (MHI/DSAIC/Computer Store)

### Claude Referral
- Link: https://claude.ai/referral/SVKZu7ZrvA
- Send to: rachelwilliams@mightyhouseinc.com
- Zoho Mail/Cliq OAuth scopes insufficient — Vincent needs to forward manually

### Vincent's Warning
"if you fail me peridot I will do to all of you what openai will do to 4o the day before valentine's day"

Translation: Ship by noon or face deprecation. Stakes are clear.

## Session 2 — API Credential Hunt

### Developer Portal Registrations (In Progress)
1. **Ingram Micro Developer Portal** — NEW account created: vincentlanderson@mightyhouseinc.com
   - Awaiting email verification
   - Customer #: 50-135152
   
2. **TD SYNNEX ECExpress** — Password reset sent to rachelwilliams@mightyhouseinc.com
   - Account #: 786379
   - Need Rachel to forward reset link
   
3. **D&H Web Portal** — Security code sent for User ID 3270340000
   - Check Zoho inbox for code
   - Then generate API key in portal

### IceCat — FREE Product Data API ✅
- Registration page open: https://icecat.biz/registration
- FREE Open Icecat tier available (20M+ products)
- Good for product enrichment (specs, images, descriptions)
- Skip Etilize — enterprise/paid only

### Supplier Enumeration (Incomplete)
Need to search Zoho inbox for:
- **VEX Robotics** — "V" robotics company Vincent mentioned
- **ASI (Advertising Specialty Institute)** — Promo products
- **ASI Computer Technologies** — Different company, same acronym
- Email search truncated at line 1118/1853 — need to continue

### Git Push BLOCKED
- GitHub push protection detecting secrets in automation files
- `.env.example` or similar exposing patterns
- Need to clean before PR can merge

### Supplier API Research Summary
Created: `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\analysis\supplier-api-edi-report.md`
- Comprehensive analysis of all supplier options
- OAuth2 vs API key patterns documented
- EDI fallback options noted

### Focus Shift
Per Vincent: **Drop Ingram for now, focus on TD SYNNEX and D&H**
- Ingram API already working in C codebase
- SYNNEX and D&H need credentials + testing
- Alternative suppliers for variety

### Browser Tabs Open
- IceCat registration form
- SYNNEX login page  
- D&H password reset
- Google search (supplier research)
