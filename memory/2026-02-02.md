## MixPost-Malone Deployment Progress

### What We Did
1. **GitHub Codespaces Issues**: Spent significant time with codespaces stuck in "Queued" state. Eventually got `glowing-spoon-wxw6wj4wx9h59x5` working.

2. **Docker Problems**: Original devcontainer used docker-compose but services showed "No running process". SSH unavailable in container.

3. **Pivoted to Direct Deploy**: User asked "does docker actually make this easier?" - honest answer was NO for this case.

4. **Simplified Devcontainer**: Created new devcontainer.json without Docker:
   - Uses `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/php:8.2` image directly
   - Added `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/sshd:1` for SSH access
   - Pushed to `ludoplex/mixpost-malone` main branch

5. **Laravel App Setup** (via gh codespace ssh):
   - Created fresh Laravel 12 app at `/workspaces/mixpost-app`
   - Installed mixpost-malone package via local path: `composer config repositories.mixpost-malone path ../mixpost-malone`
   - Used `--ignore-platform-req=ext-pcntl` to bypass Horizon's pcntl requirement
   - Installed Laravel Breeze for auth routes
   - Ran migrations

6. **MixPost Running**: App accessible at `https://glowing-spoon-wxw6wj4wx9h59x5-8000.app.github.dev/`

### Key Learnings
- **pcntl extension**: Horizon requires it but devcontainer PHP doesn't have it. Use `--ignore-platform-req=ext-pcntl` for dev.
- **Mixpost is a package**: Not a standalone app - needs Laravel host application
- **gh codespace ssh**: Works when devcontainer has sshd feature enabled
- **Browser control unstable**: Tabs lose connection after navigation, need re-focus

### Codespace Details
- **Name**: `glowing-spoon-wxw6wj4wx9h59x5`
- **Repo**: `ludoplex/mixpost-malone`
- **App path**: `/workspaces/mixpost-app`
- **Package path**: `/workspaces/mixpost-malone`
- **URL**: `https://glowing-spoon-wxw6wj4wx9h59x5-8000.app.github.dev/`

### Test Account Created
- Email: admin@example.com
- Password: password123

### Files Changed
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` - Simplified to direct PHP (no Docker)
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.docker.json` - Backup of original Docker config

### Next Steps
- Verify Mixpost UI works after login
- Test custom providers (Twitch, Whatnot, Discord, YouTube, TikTok)
- Configure social provider API credentials
- Saturday: Final testing, production deployment prep
