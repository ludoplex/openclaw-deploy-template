# Memory Flush — 2026-02-04 Evening Session (Pre-Compaction)

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Claude.ai Skills Ported to OpenClaw ✅
- **7 skills, 40 files, 293KB** extracted from Claude.ai conversation (Jan 10, 2026)
- Used Chrome relay to browser-evaluate code blocks, downloaded as JSON via blob URL, Python script distributed to skill directories
- Committed as `f44d87d`, pushed to GitHub
- Skills: operational-substrate, advanced-search, web-reconnaissance, gov-financial-intel, deep-directory-index, industry-power-map, tech-security-analysis
- Located at `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\workspace\skills\`
- **NOT yet wired into gateway config** — skills exist on disk but not registered with OpenClaw skill loader

### 2. Statistical Analysis Agent Created (statanalysis 📈)
- **Agent #21** — `C:\Users\user\.openclaw\agents\statanalysis`
- Workspace, AGENTS.md, SOUL.md created
- Registered in gateway config via config.patch
- Focus: anomaly detection, pattern recognition, coincidence quantification
- Tools: coding profile + web_search, web_fetch, browser

### 3. AI Void Analysis — 4 Public Repos
**Original investigation:** Do AI content generators disproportionately use void/dissolution semantics?

**Repos created:**
- https://github.com/ludoplex/ai-void-analysis (main, all reviews) — commit `b2b4ffe`
- https://github.com/ludoplex/ai-elevenlabs-analysis (Team ElevenLabs)
- https://github.com/ludoplex/ai-arena-analysis (Team Arena/LM Arena)
- https://github.com/ludoplex/ai-grok-analysis (Team Grok)

**Key finding — ElevenLabs "Shadows of Geometry":**
- 15.5% void/dissolution cluster density (30/194 words)
- 3.1× above dark prog rock baseline (5%)
- Z-score +6.69, p < 0.00001
- Word "void" appears once, but field saturated via synonyms: fracture(5×), bleed(3×), shadow(3×), ghost(2×)

**5-agent review completed:**
- statanalysis: Lead analysis
- webdev: Prompt bias likely driver, N=1 too small, need controlled experiment
- cosmo: Transformer attention feedback loop creates semantic attractor basins; built `void-cluster-analyzer.c` (Cosmopolitan C)
- testcov: SHARP critique — semantic neighbor list is central weakness, baselines unverifiable, independence assumption violated, need permutation test
- cicd: Designed 4-stage automated pipeline (Collect→Analyze→Compare→Alert)

### 4. Scope Expansion — ALL Anomalies, Not Just Void
- Vincent requested broadening beyond void to ANY statistical outlier or improbable coincidence
- 3 teams spawned (statanalysis × 3) for ElevenLabs, Arena, Grok
- Teams still running at time of flush

### 5. Data Captured
**ElevenLabs:** Full "Shadows of Geometry" lyrics (only 1 song visible)
**Arena (arena.ai):** 160+ conversation URLs extracted with titles/previews
**Grok:** 120+ conversation titles (Jul 2025 — Feb 2026), ~90% technical

### 6. Sensitive Content Flagged for Omission
Per Vincent's instruction to omit sensitive content from public repos:
- SSDI/SSI/TPD + Morgan Stanley inheritance
- Lawyer text discovery subpoena
- NSFW image generation requests
- Wyoming Mental Health client business
- LinkedIn identity linkage
- Commission rates/business financials
- **Awaiting Vincent's confirmation before bulk extraction**

## Technical Lessons

### Chrome Relay Instability
- Relay frequently drops after: gateway restarts, opening new tabs, navigation within tabs
- Only the actively focused tab reliably responds
- Blob URL download works for first download; subsequent downloads blocked by Chrome multi-download policy
- Navigation via `window.location.href` kills the relay connection for that tab
- **Workaround:** Open new tabs via `browser open`, don't navigate existing ones

### Bulk Data Extraction Pattern
1. Browser evaluate to collect data as JSON
2. Blob URL download to Chrome's Downloads folder
3. Copy to workspace via PowerShell
4. Python script to parse JSON and distribute to files
- This pattern worked for the 40-file skill extraction (293KB)

### Config Patch for Agent Addition
- Adding new agent requires full `agents.list` array in config.patch (not just the new entry)
- Gateway restart via SIGUSR1 after config.patch
- `commands.restart: false` means manual restart needed

## State at Flush
- 3 statanalysis sub-agents running (team-elevenlabs-lead, team-arena-lead, team-grok-lead)
- Chrome relay disconnected — needs re-attachment
- 160+ Arena conversation URLs captured but not yet extracted
- Vincent wants EVERY session extracted with 1:1 copies in repos
- Total agent count: 21 (added statanalysis)

## Next Steps (Post-Compaction)
1. Get Vincent's confirmation on sensitive content omission list
2. Re-attach Chrome relay and begin bulk conversation extraction (oldest → newest)
3. Extract Arena conversations first (160+ URLs available)
4. Extract Grok conversations (need per-chat navigation)
5. Spawn review teams (webdev + cosmo + testcov + cicd × 3 platforms) after leads complete
6. Analysis scope: ALL statistical outliers, not just void/dissolution
7. Wire the 7 ported skills into OpenClaw gateway config for all agents
