## Reasoning (Thinking Blocks)

### 2026-02-06T19:14:55.562Z
```
I need to conduct research on several topics related to the firearms/ballistics industry. Let me start by creating the research directory and then conducting web searches for each topic.

Let me begin with the searches for all four areas.
```

### 2026-02-06T19:15:00.411Z
```
Web search is not available. Let me try web_fetch to directly access the relevant websites instead.
```

### 2026-02-06T19:15:19.029Z
```
Good progress. I found some NRA info. Let me try more specific URLs for exhibitor info and PRS schedule. The 404 error for the exhibitor page revealed a menu with useful links.
```

### 2026-02-06T19:15:27.971Z
```
Good data from NRA. Let me get more info on training schools and influencers, and try different PRS/NRL URLs.
```

### 2026-02-06T19:15:37.978Z
```
I got Gunsite info but FTW Ranch domain seems to be for sale. Let me look for FTW SAAM and try other training schools. Let me also get more info on PRS and NRL.
```

### 2026-02-06T19:15:50.486Z
```
Got good info on FTW SAAM and Gunsite. Now let me get more on training schools and influencer info. Let me also try the NRA prospectus PDF and other URLs.
```

### 2026-02-06T19:16:12.702Z
```
Good info on FTW. Now let me try to get more info on PRS from correct URL paths and gather influencer info from Sniper's Hide and other sources.
```

### 2026-02-06T19:16:24.511Z
```
Great info on NRA and Sniper's Hide. Let me now fetch more influencer info and try to get NRL/PRS details from other sources.
```

### 2026-02-06T19:16:41.750Z
```
Let me now gather a few more items on influencers and NRL, then compile the research files.
```

[Fri 2026-02-06 12:14 MST] RESEARCH TASK — Use Browser + Advanced Search

**Instructions from Vincent:**
1. Use the headless browser (profile="openclaw") for real research
2. Use advanced search operators (site:, filetype:, daterange:, etc.)
3. Document everything to local files
4. Collaborate with Analyst on a final report

**Your Research Focus:**
1. **NRA Annual 2026** — exhibitor costs, booth sizes, deadline, floor plan availability
2. **PRS/NRL Events** — 2026 schedule, sponsorship packages, contact info
3. **Training Schools** — Accuracy 1st, FTW Ranch, Gunsite — instructor contacts, partnership opportunities
4. **Influencers** — Key YouTube/podcast personalities, sponsorship rates if available

**Search Operator Examples:**
- `site:nraam.org exhibitor 2026`
- `site:precisionrifleseries.com sponsor`
- `"applied ballistics" pricing site:snipershide.com`
- `"todd hodnett" contact`

**Deliverables:**
1. `memory/gundom-research/nra-2026-exhibitor-info.md`
2. `memory/gundom-research/prs-nrl-2026-calendar.md`
3. `memory/gundom-research/training-schools-contacts.md`
4. `memory/gundom-research/influencer-landscape.md`

Create the `memory/gundom-research/` directory if needed.

When complete, coordinate with Analyst for the combined final report.

However, with each right comes an equal responsibility to discharge that right effectively, legally, safely and within the bounds of morality. Rights demand responsibility.\n\n“Owning a piano does not make one a pianist any more than owning a handgun makes one a good shooter.”\n\nLt. Col.

Here, we teach Marksmanship – how to hit what you aim at. However, Gunsite goes beyond this simple discipline to include the principles of Gun-handling and Mind-set. This we call the Combat Triad. We offer multiple levels of instruction in handgun, carbine, shotgun, bolt action rifle and precision rifle. Each discipline is informed by the Combat Triad. Each Instructor at Gunsite is someone who has served in Law Enforcement, the military or both. Each Instructor is fully imbued with the doctrine and tradition of our school.\n\nHere at Gunsite, you will spend a week discovering a level of capability that you did not think possible of yourself. With the company of like-minded students, supportive Instructors and in a friendly and challenging atmosphere, you will undergo a graduated, comprehensive system of education that will improve you as a practitioner and perhaps, as a person.\n\nGunsite offers this comprehensive training to all people of verifiable character. If you meet a few simple criteria, and are ready to learn a life-saving skill, please join us here in northern Arizona for a week that will expand your abilities and horizons.\n<<<END_EXTERNAL_UNTRUSTED_CONTENT>>>"

However, with each right comes an equal responsibility to discharge that right effectively, legally, safely and within the bounds of morality. Rights demand responsibility. Owning a piano does not make one a pianist any more than owning a handgun makes one a good shooter.

View some of the most popular options [here](/exhibit/advertising-sponsorship-opportunities/).\n\n Who can attend the NRA Annual Meetings & Exhibits?\n\n The NRA Annual Meetings and Exhibits is open to all NRA members (and immediate family), uniformed military, law enforcement and organized youth groups. Non-members may join NRA on-site to gain entry in to the Show.\n\n How does Exhibitor Move-In work?\n\n At the NRA Annual Meetings & Exhibits, there are two types of onsite move-in; traditional material handling, and POV.  Material Handling is the unloading of exhibit materials.  It includes delivery to your booth from the docks, handling of empty containers, and removal of materials from your booth for reloading onto your outbound carrier for a fee.  It is an essential service for many large exhibits and is provided by our general service contractor, GES. However, many of our smaller exhibitors may find this service expensive and unnecessary, especially when their material can fit in their own vehicle and be easily carried by hand! POV Move In is designed to allow smaller exhibitors to quickly and efficiently move in without competing with large commercial vehicles at the docks or incurring extraneous labor costs.  To qualify for POV Move In, you must be driving a vehicle weighing under one ton, (pickups, vans and SUVs all qualify,) and you must be able to empty your vehicle in 20 minutes.\n\n How do I update my online Directory Listing?\n\n [Click here](https://nraam2026.exh.mapyourshow.com/)https://nraam2024.exh.mapyourshow.com/to go to the Exhibitor Dashboard and enter your Exhibitor ID and Password.  Go to \"Directory Listing\"\n\nForgot your password? Go to the Exhibitor Dashboard link above and click \"Forgot Exhibitor ID or Password?\" and enter your primary contact email address to have it resent. If you need further assistance, email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\n What if a non-official Contractor contacts me? Can I use them?\n\n Companies not selected by the NRA may reach out to you in order to solicit your business. This is happening most aggressively with housing companies. Please note that NRA Housing (ConferenceDirect[)](https://book.passkey.com/event/49903591/owner/6893/home) is our exclusive housing provider.   If you provide your credit card information to any other unauthorized vendors, your card may be charged, but you may not have a reservation when you arrive in Houston.\n\n What is Material Handling?\n\n Material Handling is the moving of materials from point A to point B. Whether your materials are sent in advance to the Service Contractor's warehouse or directly to Show site, they still need to get to your booth after the carrier drops them off. Paying for handling entitles you to have your freight brought to your booth from the loading dock, empty containers stored during the Show, empty containers returned to your booth at the close of the Show, and your freight carried back to the loading dock and loaded onto the carrier at the conclusion of the Show. Then you arrange for a carrier to pick up your exhibit materials for transport to the next destination. There is usually a 200 pound minimum per shipment charge for material handling. \n\n What can GES do for me?\n\n GES is our general service contractor and they can do it all! \n\n- Provide additional furnishings\n\n- Provide labor to assist move in or to erect your display\n\n- Track shipments\n\n- Verify order fulfillment\n\n- Answer questions regarding outbound bills of lading\n\n- Schedule outbound shipping through GES Logistics\n\n- Review order confirmations and billing\n\n- Remove empty crates (these should be labeled with an “EMPTY” sticker, found at the GES Service Desk as soon as they have been unpacked to keep the aisles clear and allow carpet installation.\n\nQuestions for GES? Please call them directly at 800-801-7648\n\n What is provided with my booth?\n\n Standard Booth Package:\nBooth Size: 10' x 10'\n8' High Backwall Drape: Red / White / Red\n3' High Sidewall Drape: Red\nAisle Carpet Color: Blue Jay\nPlease Note: The Facility is Not Carpeted.\n\n11\"x17\" Booth ID Sign\n\n How do I secure my firearms overnight at the Show?\n\n All firearms must be secured at night by either hiring overnight security, cabled and locked to the booth or taken to the Overnight Storage Room in a lockable storage room.\n\n I need extra meeting space during the show ... is that possible?\n\n Yes! We have meeting rooms for exhibitors to reserve at the George R. Brown Convention Center,  Marriott Marquis Houston, and Hilton Americas-Houston. [Click here](/exhibit/exhibitor-meeting-space-request/) to review the options and complete the form.\n<<<END_EXTERNAL_UNTRUSTED_CONTENT>>>"
