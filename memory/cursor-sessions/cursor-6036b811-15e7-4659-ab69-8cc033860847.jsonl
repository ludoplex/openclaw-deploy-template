Primary Request and Intent:\\nThe user wants a complete specification for the Puter.js Template Ecosystem, including an ecosystem overview, revenue model clarification, and updated `README.md`, `INDEX.md`, `index.html`, `index.json`, `bookmarks.json`, `bookmarks.html`, and `REVENUE_SHARING.md` files. The user also specifically requested to enumerate all methods of receiving contributions on their own, and provide an easy and convenient way to integrate them alongside the template\u0027s ask/note for contributions. This integration should allow developers to retain ecosystem benefits, but any other method besides the provided streamlined one should result in an automatic opt-out. Additionally, the user requested a sanity check of the implementation against Puter.js documentation and the `ludoplex/puter.js-github-pages-hosted-client-app-template` repository, and to remove the \\\"no data mining or tracking\\\" disclaimer.\\n\\nMore recently, the user requested an automated system for the ecosystem, suggesting the use of Puter.js, decentralized database systems like IPFS, a FLOSS blockchain, BitTorrent, magnet links, and I2P. The user then asked for a description of how this decentralized system interfaces with Puter.js apps deployed via the GitHub template, and finally requested a Product Requirements Document (PRD) including a Control Flow Graph (CFG), all functions and variables, and a list of files.\\n\\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\\n- Puter.js: A JavaScript library for serverless, cloud-powered applications.\\n- GitHub Pages: Hosting for single-file web applications.\\n- Ecosystem Benefits: App Index, Cross-App Integration, Puter.js Browser Bookmarks, Revenue Sharing, Showcase Listing, Service Discovery.\\n- Revenue Model: Per-app revenue sharing based on GitHub stars, with separate developer-owned donation options.\\n- Attribution: Required for ecosystem participation.\\n- GitHub Actions: Automated workflows for deployment, CI/CD, and milestone promotion.\\n- JSON and Markdown: Formats for app directory and documentation.\\n- Browser Bookmarks: JSON and HTML formats for Puter.js browser integration.\\n- Stripe: Implied payment processor for template contributions.\\n- Decentralized Architecture: IPFS, Filecoin, Arweave for storage; Attestation Chain for consensus; BitTorrent/Magnet Links for distribution; I2P/Tor/Lokinet for privacy.\\n- Compliance Scanning: Automated detection of external contribution methods and missing ecosystem footer.\\n- Cryptographic Verification: Ed25519 signatures, SHA256 content hashes.\\n\\n3. Files and Code Sections:\\n- `https://github.com/ludoplex/puter.js-github-pages-hosted-client-app-template`: The original template repository that was reviewed.\\n- `index.html`: The core of the Puter.js single-file application template. It includes the Puter.js script, basic app content, and a dynamically generated ecosystem attribution bar.\\n  - The user provided a complete `index.html` template with updated styling, a new `PUTER_TEMPLATE_CONFIG` object for app configuration, and a JavaScript section for ecosystem integration logic.\\n  - The `index.html` was updated to include the exclusive ecosystem footer.\\n- `README.md`: The user provided a complete `README.md` for the template, detailing the quick start, ecosystem advantages, app directory, revenue sharing program, Puter.js browser integration, community showcase, and support. It was updated to remove \\\"no data mining or tracking\\\" claims.\\n- `DIRECTORY.md`: This file is the full app index, categorizing various Puter.js applications. The user provided a complete `INDEX.md` with categories like Developer Tools, Productivity, Creative \u0026 Design, Utilities, Games \u0026 Entertainment, Education, Communication, Finance, and Data \u0026 Analytics. This was created as `DIRECTORY.md`.\\n- `ecosystem/directory.json`: This JSON file serves as the machine-readable app index for ecosystem browsing. The user provided a complete `index.json` with app details, categories, and statistics. This was created as `ecosystem/directory.json`.\\n- `ecosystem/registry.json`: A new file created to store the registry of compliant apps.\\n- `ecosystem/footer.css`: A new file created to contain the styles for the exclusive ecosystem footer.\\n- `scripts/detect-external-contributions.js`: This script was created to scan deployed apps for external donation/contribution methods.\\n  - It includes `DETECTION_PATTERNS` for various platforms, crypto addresses, widgets, and semantic keywords.\\n  - It also includes `ALLOWED_PATTERNS` to whitelist the ecosystem\u0027s own contribution link.\\n  - The script was updated to explicitly detect a missing ecosystem footer as an opt-out reason.\\n  - The module exports were updated to include `ExternalContributionDetector`, `DETECTION_PATTERNS`, and `ALLOWED_PATTERNS`.\\n- `.github/workflows/verify-ecosystem.yml`: This GitHub Actions workflow was created to run daily compliance verification.\\n  - It fetches registered apps, scans for external contributions using `detect-external-contributions.js`, updates compliance status, and generates delisting notices.\\n  - It was updated to create specific issues for \\\"Ecosystem Footer Removed - De Facto Opt-Out\\\" and \\\"Compliance Violation Detected\\\" based on the `optOutReason`.\\n- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: A new GitHub Actions workflow for GitHub Pages deployment.\\n- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/directory-submission.yml`: A new YAML file for app submission templates.\\n- `EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md`: A new document created to explain the exclusive contribution model, opt-out triggers, and the benefits matrix. It was updated to reflect the explicit footer removal opt-out.\\n- `docs/DECENTRALIZED_ARCHITECTURE.md`: A new document detailing the decentralized architecture, including IPFS, Attestation Chain, BitTorrent, and privacy layers.\\n- `lib/ipfs-storage.js`: A new file for IPFS integration, handling content-addressed storage for registry and compliance data.\\n- `lib/attestation-chain.js`: A new file for designing a signed attestation chain for immutable records without blockchain fees.\\n- `lib/torrent-distribution.js`: A new file for implementing BitTorrent/magnet link distribution for the directory.\\n- `lib/privacy-layer.js`: A new file for adding I2P/Tor/Lokinet privacy layers for anonymous verification.\\n- `lib/ecosystem-node.js`: A new file for the main orchestrator that ties all decentralized systems together.\\n- `verifier/index.html`: A new file for a browser-based Puter.js verifier application.\\n- `.gitignore`: A new file for standard ignore patterns.\\n\\n4. Errors and fixes:\\n- **Error**: `Error: Failed to create Browserbase session: Failed to ensure default session browserbase_session_main_1767909894860 after initial error and retry: Failed to create/connect session browserbase_session_main_1767909894860: Unauthorized. Ensure you provided a valid API key and that it is whitelisted.`\\n  - **Fix**: The assistant did not fix this error but proceeded with other available information, as it was an external API key issue.\\n- **Error**: `Error calling tool: Unable to write file \u0027\\\\index.html\u0027 (NoPermissions (FileSystemError): Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, open \u0027C:\\\\index.html\u0027)`\\n  - **Fix**: The assistant realized it was trying to write to the root directory and created a `puter-app-template` directory in the user\u0027s home directory (`C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\puter-app-template`) to store all files.\\n- **Error**: `Copy-Item : Cannot find path \u0027C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\puter-app-template\\\\scripts\\\\detect-external-contributions.js\u0027 because it does not exist.`\\n  - **Fix**: This occurred because the `scripts` directory was created after the `detect-external-contributions.js` file was initially written. The assistant re-created the file in the correct path after ensuring the directory structure was in place.\\n- **Error**: The `detect-external-contributions.js` script initially flagged the ecosystem\u0027s own contribution link as a violation.\\n  - **Fix**: The `ALLOWED_PATTERNS` in `scripts/detect-external-contributions.js` were updated to correctly whitelist the ecosystem\u0027s contribution link, specifically looking for `data-ecosystem-version`, `puter-ecosystem-footer`, `ecosystem-contribution-link`, `?ref=puter-ecosystem`, and `class=[\\\"\u0027].*ecosystem.*[\\\"\u0027]`.\\n- **User Feedback**: The user asked, \\\"if a dev uses the template but removes the payment and verification part, is there a mechanism which will remove them from the ecosystem as that is a defacto opt out\\\".\\n  - **Fix**: The `scripts/detect-external-contributions.js` was updated to explicitly check for the presence of the ecosystem footer. If missing, it now reports `footerRemoved: true` and `optOutReason: \\\"FOOTER_REMOVED\\\"`. The `verify-ecosystem.yml` workflow was also updated to create a specific issue for \\\"Ecosystem Footer Removed - De Facto Opt-Out\\\" in this scenario. The `EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md` was updated to reflect this explicit opt-out condition.\\n\\n5. Problem Solving:\\n- The initial problem was to define a complete ecosystem specification and an exclusive contribution model. This involved creating numerous documentation and code files.\\n- A key challenge was implementing a robust detection system for external contribution methods while allowing the ecosystem\u0027s own contribution mechanism. This was solved by defining comprehensive regex patterns for various platforms and keywords, alongside a whitelist for the official ecosystem footer.\\n- The user\u0027s concern about developers removing the ecosystem footer was addressed by adding explicit detection for its absence, ensuring that such an action is recognized as a de facto opt-out.\\n- The transition to a decentralized architecture involved designing and implementing modules for IPFS storage, an attestation chain, BitTorrent distribution, and privacy layers (I2P/Tor/Lokinet), all orchestrated by a central `ecosystem-node.js`.\\n\\n6.

Primary Request and Intent:\\nThe user wants a complete specification for the Puter.js Template Ecosystem, including an ecosystem overview, revenue model clarification, a complete `README.md`, a full app index (`INDEX.md`), a complete `index.html` template, an App Index JSON for ecosystem browsing, Puter.js Browser Bookmarks Export, and a Revenue Tracking Clarification Document.\\n\\nSpecifically, the user requested to:\\n- Enumerate all methods of receiving contributions on their own.\\n- Provide an easy and convenient way to integrate these methods alongside the ecosystem\u0027s contribution ask/note, ensuring that developers retain ecosystem benefits.\\n- Implement a mechanism where any other contribution method besides the \\\"convenient and streamlined method\\\" (the ecosystem\u0027s revenue sharing) automatically triggers an opt-out from ecosystem benefits.\\n- Review Puter.js documentation for sanity checks on the implementation.\\n- Remove the \\\"no data mining or tracking\\\" disclaimer from the `index.html` as it was not specified by the user.\\n\\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\\n- **Puter.js Template Ecosystem**: A system for serverless, cloud-powered applications using Puter.js and GitHub Pages, offering benefits like app indexing, cross-app integration, browser bookmarks, and revenue sharing.\\n- **Ecosystem Participation**: Maintaining template attribution in an app to gain access to ecosystem benefits.\\n- **Revenue Sharing Model**: A per-app, tiered system where developers earn a percentage of donations made through their app\u0027s *template attribution link*, based on GitHub stars.\\n- **Exclusive Contribution Model**: A new model where developers must *only* use the ecosystem\u0027s provided contribution method to remain opted-in for ecosystem benefits. Any external contribution method detected will result in automatic opt-out.\\n- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting for single-file Puter.js applications.\\n- **GitHub Actions**: Automated workflows for deployment, CI/CD, and ecosystem verification.\\n- **External Contribution Detection**: Scripting and regex patterns to identify non-compliant donation methods within an app\u0027s code or deployed content.\\n- **Puter.js APIs**: Cloud Storage (`puter.fs`), AI Integration (`puter.ai`), Authentication (`puter.auth`), NoSQL Database (`puter.kv`), Web Hosting (`puter.hosting`).\\n- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Core technologies for the single-file applications and the ecosystem\u0027s UI components.\\n- **JSON**: Format for machine-readable app index and browser bookmarks.\\n- **Markdown**: Format for documentation files (`README.md`, `DIRECTORY.md`, `REVENUE_SHARING.md`, `EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md`).\\n\\n3. Files and Code Sections:\\n\\n- **`scripts/detect-external-contributions.js`**\\n  - **Summary**: This script is crucial for enforcing the exclusive contribution model. It contains regex patterns to detect various external donation platforms, crypto addresses, widgets, and semantic keywords. It also defines `ALLOWED_PATTERNS` to identify the ecosystem\u0027s official attribution. The script scans HTML content or `FUNDING.yml` files to determine compliance.\\n  - **Changes Made**: Created this file from scratch.\\n  - **Important Code Snippet**:\\n    ```javascript\\n    const DETECTION_PATTERNS = {\\n        // Direct Payment Platforms\\n        platforms: [\\n            { pattern: /github\\\\.com\\\\/sponsors\\\\//i, name: \u0027GitHub Sponsors\u0027 },\\n            { pattern: /ko-fi\\\\.com/i, name: \u0027Ko-fi\u0027 },\\n            { pattern: /buymeacoffee\\\\.com/i, name: \u0027Buy Me a Coffee\u0027 },\\n            { pattern: /paypal\\\\.com\\\\/donate/i, name: \u0027PayPal Donate\u0027 },\\n            { pattern: /buy\\\\.stripe\\\\.com(?!.*\\\\?ref=puter-ecosystem)/i, name: \u0027Stripe Payment Link (non-ecosystem)\u0027 },\\n            // ... many more patterns\\n        ],\\n        // Cryptocurrency Wallet Addresses\\n        crypto: [\\n            { pattern: /\\\\b(bc1[a-zA-HJ-NP-Z0-9]{39,59})\\\\b/, name: \u0027Bitcoin (bech32)\u0027 },\\n            { pattern: /\\\\b(0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40})\\\\b/, name: \u0027Ethereum/EVM Address\u0027 },\\n            // ... more crypto patterns\\n        ],\\n        // Widget Embeds\\n        widgets: [\\n            { pattern: /kofi-widget/i, name: \u0027Ko-fi Widget\u0027 },\\n            { pattern: /bmc-button/i, name: \u0027Buy Me a Coffee Button\u0027 },\\n            // ... more widget patterns\\n        ],\\n        // Semantic Keywords Near Links\\n        semanticPatterns: [\\n            { \\n                pattern: /\u003ca[^\u003e]*href=[^\u003e]*\u003e.*?\\\\b(donate|donation|tip|sponsor|support\\\\s*me|buy\\\\s*me|fund|contribute)\\\\b.*?\u003c\\\\/a\u003e/gi, \\n                name: \u0027Donation Link Text\u0027 \\n            },\\n        ],\\n        // FUNDING.yml indicators\\n        fundingYml: [\\n            { pattern: /\\\\.github\\\\/FUNDING\\\\.yml/i, name: \u0027FUNDING.yml Present\u0027 },\\n        ]\\n    };\\n\\n    const ALLOWED_PATTERNS = [\\n        /data-ecosystem-version/i,\\n        /puter-ecosystem-footer/i,\\n        /ecosystem-contribution-link/i,\\n        /\\\\?ref=puter-ecosystem/i,\\n        /class=[\\\"\u0027].*ecosystem.*[\\\"\u0027]/i\\n    ];\\n    ```\\n\\n- **`ecosystem/footer.css`**\\n  - **Summary**: Defines the styling for the exclusive ecosystem attribution footer, ensuring it\u0027s visually distinct and integrated while allowing customization.\\n  - **Changes Made**: Created this file from scratch.\\n  - **Important Code Snippet**: (Styling for `.ecosystem-footer`, `.ecosystem-footer a`, `.ecosystem-footer .heart`, etc.)\\n\\n- **`ecosystem/footer.js`**\\n  - **Summary**: Contains the JavaScript logic for the ecosystem footer, including configuration, dynamic rendering, and handling of user interactions (e.g., minimizing/hiding the footer).

No direct changes related to the exclusive contribution model, but it\u0027s part of the overall ecosystem infrastructure.\\n  - **Changes Made**: Created this file from scratch.\\n\\n4. Errors and fixes:\\n\\n- **Error**: `Error calling tool: Directory not found:`\\n  - **How you fixed the error**: This occurred because the workspace was empty. I created the necessary directory structure (`puter-app-template`, `scripts`, `.github/workflows`, `ecosystem`) to house the new files.\\n- **Error**: `Error calling tool: Unable to write file \u0027\\\\index.html\u0027 (NoPermissions (FileSystemError): Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, open \u0027C:\\\\index.html\u0027)`\\n  - **How you fixed the error**: This was a pathing issue where the system tried to write to the root directory. I corrected the path to `C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\puter-app-template\\\\index.html` after creating the `puter-app-template` directory.\\n\\n5. Problem Solving:\\n- **Implementing the Exclusive Contribution Model**: The core challenge was to define \\\"external contribution methods\\\" and create a robust detection mechanism. This was solved by:\\n    - **Comprehensive Regex Patterns**: Developing a wide array of regex patterns in `scripts/detect-external-contributions.js` to cover various payment platforms, crypto addresses, widgets, and semantic keywords.\\n    - **Defining Allowed Patterns**: Explicitly defining `ALLOWED_PATTERNS` to ensure the ecosystem\u0027s own contribution link is not flagged as external.\\n    - **Automated Verification**: Designing a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/verify-ecosystem.yml`) to automatically scan deployed apps for non-compliance.\\n    - **Clear Documentation**: Creating `EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md` and updating `README.md` to clearly communicate the new policy and its consequences to developers.\\n    - **UI Integration**: Modifying `index.html` to remove the developer\u0027s own donation button and integrate the exclusive ecosystem footer, ensuring a streamlined and compliant contribution experience.\\n- **Workspace Setup**: Initially, the workspace was empty, leading to file creation errors. This was resolved by creating the base directory `puter-app-template` and its subdirectories before attempting to write files.\\n\\n6.

This is essentially asking: if someone uses the template but removes the attribution/contribution footer, how do we detect that and remove them from the ecosystem?\n\nLooking at my current implementation:\n\n1. The detection script checks for `hasEcosystemFooter` by looking for allowed patterns like `puter-ecosystem-footer`, `data-ecosystem-version`, etc.\n\n2. If the footer is missing, the app is marked as NON-COMPLIANT because compliance requires BOTH:\n   - No external contribution methods detected\n   - Ecosystem footer present\n\n3. The verification workflow runs daily and will detect this.\n\nHowever, the user is asking if there\u0027s a clear mechanism for this. Let me check my implementation more carefully and potentially enhance it to make this clearer.\n\nIn my current `scan()` function:\n```javascript\nreturn {\n    compliant: this.findings.length === 0 \u0026\u0026 hasEcosystemFooter,\n    hasEcosystemFooter,\n    externalMethodsDetected: this.findings.length \u003e 0,\n    findings: this.findings,\n    summary: this.getSummary()\n};\n```\n\nSo `compliant` is only true if:\n1.

It features a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with 480 billion total parameters, of which 35 billion are active during inference. This design allows for efficient handling of complex coding tasks. The model natively supports a context length of 256,000 tokens, extendable up to 1 million tokens using context extrapolation techniques like YaRN. It has demonstrated leading performance among open models on several agentic evaluation suites, including a 69.6% score on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, placing it on par with models like Claude Sonnet 4. ([venturebeat.com](https://venturebeat.com/programming-development/qwen3-coder-480b-a35b-instruct-launches-and-it-might-be-the-best-coding-model-yet/?utm_source=openai))\\n\\nThe **Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-GGUF** is a quantized variant of the Qwen3-Coder series, designed for more efficient deployment. It utilizes the GGUF quantization format, offering various precision levels from 1-bit to 16-bit. The 4-bit version, for instance, requires only 18.6GB of storage, making it suitable for deployment on consumer-grade GPUs. Despite the reduced precision, this model maintains high performance, achieving a 72.3% accuracy on the HumanEval coding benchmark, with only a 2.1 percentage point drop compared to its 16-bit counterpart. ([blog.csdn.net](https://blog.csdn.net/gitblog_00324/article/details/154216141?utm_source=openai))\\n\\nIn summary, the Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct offers superior code generation performance, particularly for complex and large-scale tasks, due to its extensive parameter count and context handling capabilities. The Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-GGUF provides a more resource-efficient alternative with commendable performance, making it suitable for scenarios where computational resources are limited. \"}],\"isFinal\":true}"}},"bubbleId":"15547306-76d5-49dd-bd27-e45389214c71"}

Registry stored on IPFS (multiple gateways)\n   - Attestation chain replicated across nodes\n   - BitTorrent ensures data availability\n\n2. **Cryptographic Verification**\n   - Ed25519 signatures on all attestations\n   - SHA256 content hashes for integrity\n   - Chain of attestations prevents tampering\n\n3. **Privacy-Preserving Operations**\n   - Anonymous app submissions via I2P/Tor\n   - Hidden service verifiers\n   - Zero-knowledge compliance proofs\n\n4. **Automatic Opt-Out Detection**\n   - Footer removal detected as de facto opt-out\n   - External contribution methods scanned daily\n   - Violations create signed attestations\n\n### Usage\n\n```powershell\n# Run ecosystem node\nnode lib/ecosystem-node.js start\n\n# Verify a single app\nnode lib/ecosystem-node.js verify https://user.github.io/app\n\n# Run full compliance scan\nnode lib/ecosystem-node.js scan\n\n# Export all data\nnode lib/ecosystem-node.js export\n```\n\nThe system is now fully decentralized - no central authority can censor the registry or tamper with compliance records.","usageUuid":"b93d4b21-2248-47b7-a7eb-be834c99710f","codeBlocks":[{"unregistered":true,"content":"puter-app-template/\n|-- index.html                      # Main template with ecosystem footer\n|-- README.md                       # Documentation\n|-- EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md              # Contribution model docs\n|-- DIRECTORY.md                    # App directory\n|-- .gitignore\n|\n|-- docs/\n|   |-- DECENTRALIZED_ARCHITECTURE.md   # Full architecture documentation\n|\n|-- lib/\n|   |-- ipfs-storage.js             # IPFS integration (gateways, pinning)\n|   |-- attestation-chain.js        # Signed attestation chain (no blockchain fees)\n|   |-- torrent-distribution.js     # BitTorrent/magnet link distribution\n|   |-- privacy-layer.js            # I2P, Tor, Lokinet integration\n|   |-- ecosystem-node.js           # Main orchestrator\n|\n|-- scripts/\n|   |-- detect-external-contributions.js  # Compliance scanner\n|\n|-- ecosystem/\n|   |-- registry.json               # Registered apps\n|   |-- directory.json              # App categories\n|   |-- footer.css                  # Footer styles\n|\n|-- verifier/\n|   |-- index.html                  # Browser-based Puter.js verifier app\n|\n|-- .github/\n    |-- workflows/\n    |   |-- deploy.yml              # GitHub Pages deployment\n    |   |-- verify-ecosystem.yml    # Daily compliance verification\n    |-- ISSUE_TEMPLATE/\n        |-- directory-submission.yml","languageId":"plaintext","isGenerating":false,"isClickable":false,"codeBlockIdx":0},{"unregistered":true,"content":"# Run ecosystem node\nnode lib/ecosystem-node.js start\n\n# Verify a single app\nnode lib/ecosystem-node.js verify https://user.github.io/app\n\n# Run full compliance scan\nnode lib/ecosystem-node.js scan\n\n# Export all data\nnode lib/ecosystem-node.js export","languageId":"powershell","isGenerating":false,"isClickable":false,"codeBlockIdx":1}],"toolFormerData":{"additionalData":{"status":"error"}}},"bubbleId":"39aab3c8-5649-4fc7-a664-82bd59d72fc6"}

However, popular apps tend to get more donations through all channels.\n\n**Q: Can I remove my own donation button?**\n\nA: Your donation button is yours. Add, remove, or modify it however you want.\n\n**Q: Can I remove the template attribution?**\n\nA: Yes, but you lose:\n- Revenue sharing eligibility\n- Listing in the app index\n- Cross-app integration\n- Puter.js browser bookmarks\n- Showcase listing\n\n**Q: What if I want higher revenue share without the stars?**\n\nA: The tier system is based on GitHub stars as a proxy for app value/popularity. You can always direct users to your OWN donation button for 100% of proceeds.\n\n**Q: Is this enforced somehow?**\n\nA: \n- Monthly automated verification checks for attribution\n- Payment registration requires GitHub ownership proof\n- Removing attribution automatically triggers delisting\nSummary\nAspect\tDescription\nEcosystem Participation\tAttribution enables index listing, cross-app integration, browser bookmarks\nRevenue Share Source\tONLY donations through template attribution on each specific app\nDeveloper\u0027s Own Donations\t100% to developer, completely separate\nOpt-Out Consequences\tLoses ALL ecosystem benefits, isolated from network\nTiers\t100Γ¡É=10%, 1kΓ¡É=15%, 10kΓ¡É=22%, 100kΓ¡É=30%\nVerification\tMonthly automated checks, delisting for non-compliance\nThis model creates a mutually beneficial ecosystem where:\n\nDevelopers get exposure, integration, and potential revenue\nTemplate gets attribution and sustainable funding\nUsers discover quality apps through the curated index\nEveryone benefits from network effects\nPuter.js Template Ecosystem ΓÇö Complete Specification\nEcosystem Overview\ntext\n\nΓöîΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÉ\nΓöé                        PUTER.JS TEMPLATE ECOSYSTEM                          Γöé\nΓö£ΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöñ\nΓöé                                                                             Γöé\nΓöé  ΓöîΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÉ    ΓöîΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÉ    ΓöîΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÉ    ΓöîΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÉ  Γöé\nΓöé  Γöé   App A     ΓöéΓùäΓöÇΓöÇΓû║Γöé   App B     ΓöéΓùäΓöÇΓöÇΓû║Γöé   App C     ΓöéΓùäΓöÇΓöÇΓû║Γöé   App D     Γöé  Γöé\nΓöé  Γöé  (opted-in) Γöé    Γöé  (opted-in) Γöé    Γöé  (opted-in) Γöé    Γöé (opted-out) Γöé  Γöé\nΓöé  ΓööΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓö¼ΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÿ    ΓööΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓö¼ΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÿ    ΓööΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓö¼ΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÿ    ΓööΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÿ  Γöé\nΓöé         Γöé                  Γöé                  Γöé                  Γ£ù          Γöé\nΓöé         ΓööΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓö╝ΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÿ           Not integrated    Γöé\nΓöé                            Γöé                                                Γöé\nΓöé                            Γû╝                                                Γöé\nΓöé  ΓöîΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÉ   Γöé\nΓöé  Γöé                    SHARED ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS                         Γöé   Γöé\nΓöé  Γöé                                                                       Γöé   Γöé\nΓöé  Γöé   ≡ƒôÜ App Directory Index    ≡ƒöû Puter Browser Bookmarks              Γöé   Γöé\nΓöé  Γöé   ≡ƒöù Cross-App Integration  ≡ƒîÉ Decentralized Resources               Γöé   Γöé\nΓöé  Γöé   ≡ƒÆ░ Revenue Share Pool     ≡ƒÅå Showcase Visibility                   Γöé   Γöé\nΓöé  ΓööΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÿ   Γöé\nΓöé                                                                             Γöé\nΓööΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÇΓöÿ\nRepository Structure\ntext\n\nputer-app-template/\nΓö£ΓöÇΓöÇ .github/\nΓöé   Γö£ΓöÇΓöÇ FUNDING.yml\nΓöé   Γö£ΓöÇΓöÇ workflows/\nΓöé   Γöé   Γö£ΓöÇΓöÇ pages.yml\nΓöé   Γöé   Γö£ΓöÇΓöÇ verify-ecosystem.yml\nΓöé   Γöé   Γö£ΓöÇΓöÇ update-directory.yml\nΓöé   Γöé   Γö£ΓöÇΓöÇ generate-bookmarks.yml\nΓöé   Γöé   ΓööΓöÇΓöÇ process-contributions.yml\nΓöé   ΓööΓöÇΓöÇ ISSUE_TEMPLATE/\nΓöé       Γö£ΓöÇΓöÇ showcase-submission.yml\nΓöé       Γö£ΓöÇΓöÇ revenue-share-optin.yml\nΓöé       ΓööΓöÇΓöÇ directory-submission.yml\nΓö£ΓöÇΓöÇ index.html\nΓö£ΓöÇΓöÇ README.md\nΓö£ΓöÇΓöÇ SHOWCASE.md\nΓö£ΓöÇΓöÇ REVENUE_SHARING.md\nΓö£ΓöÇΓöÇ DIRECTORY.md                      #

Primary Request and Intent:\\nThe user wants a complete specification for the Puter.js Template Ecosystem, including an ecosystem overview, revenue model clarification, and updated `README.md`, `INDEX.md`, `index.html`, `index.json`, `bookmarks.json`, `bookmarks.html`, and `REVENUE_SHARING.md` files. The user also specifically requested to enumerate all methods of receiving contributions on their own, and provide an easy and convenient way to integrate them alongside the template\u0027s ask/note for contributions. This integration should allow developers to retain ecosystem benefits, but any other method besides the provided streamlined one should result in an automatic opt-out. Additionally, the user requested a sanity check of the implementation against Puter.js documentation and the `ludoplex/puter.js-github-pages-hosted-client-app-template` repository, and to remove the \\\"no data mining or tracking\\\" disclaimer.\\n\\nMore recently, the user requested an automated system for the ecosystem, suggesting the use of Puter.js, decentralized database systems like IPFS, a FLOSS blockchain, BitTorrent, magnet links, and I2P. The user then asked for a description of how this decentralized system interfaces with Puter.js apps deployed via the GitHub template, and finally requested a Product Requirements Document (PRD) including a Control Flow Graph (CFG), all functions and variables, and a list of files.\\n\\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\\n- Puter.js: A JavaScript library for serverless, cloud-powered applications.\\n- GitHub Pages: Hosting for single-file web applications.\\n- Ecosystem Benefits: App Index, Cross-App Integration, Puter.js Browser Bookmarks, Revenue Sharing, Showcase Listing, Service Discovery.\\n- Revenue Model: Per-app revenue sharing based on GitHub stars, with separate developer-owned donation options.\\n- Attribution: Required for ecosystem participation.\\n- GitHub Actions: Automated workflows for deployment, CI/CD, and milestone promotion.\\n- JSON and Markdown: Formats for app directory and documentation.\\n- Browser Bookmarks: JSON and HTML formats for Puter.js browser integration.\\n- Stripe: Implied payment processor for template contributions.\\n- Decentralized Architecture: IPFS, Filecoin, Arweave for storage; Attestation Chain for consensus; BitTorrent/Magnet Links for distribution; I2P/Tor/Lokinet for privacy.\\n- Compliance Scanning: Automated detection of external contribution methods and missing ecosystem footer.\\n- Cryptographic Verification: Ed25519 signatures, SHA256 content hashes.\\n\\n3. Files and Code Sections:\\n- `https://github.com/ludoplex/puter.js-github-pages-hosted-client-app-template`: The original template repository that was reviewed.\\n- `index.html`: The core of the Puter.js single-file application template. It includes the Puter.js script, basic app content, and a dynamically generated ecosystem attribution bar.\\n  - The user provided a complete `index.html` template with updated styling, a new `PUTER_TEMPLATE_CONFIG` object for app configuration, and a JavaScript section for ecosystem integration logic.\\n  - The `index.html` was updated to include the exclusive ecosystem footer.\\n- `README.md`: The user provided a complete `README.md` for the template, detailing the quick start, ecosystem advantages, app directory, revenue sharing program, Puter.js browser integration, community showcase, and support. It was updated to remove \\\"no data mining or tracking\\\" claims.\\n- `DIRECTORY.md`: This file is the full app index, categorizing various Puter.js applications. The user provided a complete `INDEX.md` with categories like Developer Tools, Productivity, Creative \u0026 Design, Utilities, Games \u0026 Entertainment, Education, Communication, Finance, and Data \u0026 Analytics. This was created as `DIRECTORY.md`.\\n- `ecosystem/directory.json`: This JSON file serves as the machine-readable app index for ecosystem browsing. The user provided a complete `index.json` with app details, categories, and statistics. This was created as `ecosystem/directory.json`.\\n- `ecosystem/registry.json`: A new file created to store the registry of compliant apps.\\n- `ecosystem/footer.css`: A new file created to contain the styles for the exclusive ecosystem footer.\\n- `scripts/detect-external-contributions.js`: This script was created to scan deployed apps for external donation/contribution methods.\\n  - It includes `DETECTION_PATTERNS` for various platforms, crypto addresses, widgets, and semantic keywords.\\n  - It also includes `ALLOWED_PATTERNS` to whitelist the ecosystem\u0027s own contribution link.\\n  - The script was updated to explicitly detect a missing ecosystem footer as an opt-out reason.\\n  - The module exports were updated to include `ExternalContributionDetector`, `DETECTION_PATTERNS`, and `ALLOWED_PATTERNS`.\\n- `.github/workflows/verify-ecosystem.yml`: This GitHub Actions workflow was created to run daily compliance verification.\\n  - It fetches registered apps, scans for external contributions using `detect-external-contributions.js`, updates compliance status, and generates delisting notices.\\n  - It was updated to create specific issues for \\\"Ecosystem Footer Removed - De Facto Opt-Out\\\" and \\\"Compliance Violation Detected\\\" based on the `optOutReason`.\\n- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: A new GitHub Actions workflow for GitHub Pages deployment.\\n- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/directory-submission.yml`: A new YAML file for app submission templates.\\n- `EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md`: A new document created to explain the exclusive contribution model, opt-out triggers, and the benefits matrix. It was updated to reflect the explicit footer removal opt-out.\\n- `docs/DECENTRALIZED_ARCHITECTURE.md`: A new document detailing the decentralized architecture, including IPFS, Attestation Chain, BitTorrent, and privacy layers.\\n- `lib/ipfs-storage.js`: A new file for IPFS integration, handling content-addressed storage for registry and compliance data.\\n- `lib/attestation-chain.js`: A new file for designing a signed attestation chain for immutable records without blockchain fees.\\n- `lib/torrent-distribution.js`: A new file for implementing BitTorrent/magnet link distribution for the directory.\\n- `lib/privacy-layer.js`: A new file for adding I2P/Tor/Lokinet privacy layers for anonymous verification.\\n- `lib/ecosystem-node.js`: A new file for the main orchestrator that ties all decentralized systems together.\\n- `verifier/index.html`: A new file for a browser-based Puter.js verifier application.\\n- `.gitignore`: A new file for standard ignore patterns.\\n\\n4. Errors and fixes:\\n- **Error**: `Error: Failed to create Browserbase session: Failed to ensure default session browserbase_session_main_1767909894860 after initial error and retry: Failed to create/connect session browserbase_session_main_1767909894860: Unauthorized. Ensure you provided a valid API key and that it is whitelisted.`\\n  - **Fix**: The assistant did not fix this error but proceeded with other available information, as it was an external API key issue.\\n- **Error**: `Error calling tool: Unable to write file \u0027\\\\index.html\u0027 (NoPermissions (FileSystemError): Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, open \u0027C:\\\\index.html\u0027)`\\n  - **Fix**: The assistant realized it was trying to write to the root directory and created a `puter-app-template` directory in the user\u0027s home directory (`C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\puter-app-template`) to store all files.\\n- **Error**: `Copy-Item : Cannot find path \u0027C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\puter-app-template\\\\scripts\\\\detect-external-contributions.js\u0027 because it does not exist.`\\n  - **Fix**: This occurred because the `scripts` directory was created after the `detect-external-contributions.js` file was initially written. The assistant re-created the file in the correct path after ensuring the directory structure was in place.\\n- **Error**: The `detect-external-contributions.js` script initially flagged the ecosystem\u0027s own contribution link as a violation.\\n  - **Fix**: The `ALLOWED_PATTERNS` in `scripts/detect-external-contributions.js` were updated to correctly whitelist the ecosystem\u0027s contribution link, specifically looking for `data-ecosystem-version`, `puter-ecosystem-footer`, `ecosystem-contribution-link`, `?ref=puter-ecosystem`, and `class=[\\\"\u0027].*ecosystem.*[\\\"\u0027]`.\\n- **User Feedback**: The user asked, \\\"if a dev uses the template but removes the payment and verification part, is there a mechanism which will remove them from the ecosystem as that is a defacto opt out\\\".\\n  - **Fix**: The `scripts/detect-external-contributions.js` was updated to explicitly check for the presence of the ecosystem footer. If missing, it now reports `footerRemoved: true` and `optOutReason: \\\"FOOTER_REMOVED\\\"`. The `verify-ecosystem.yml` workflow was also updated to create a specific issue for \\\"Ecosystem Footer Removed - De Facto Opt-Out\\\" in this scenario. The `EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md` was updated to reflect this explicit opt-out condition.\\n\\n5. Problem Solving:\\n- The initial problem was to define a complete ecosystem specification and an exclusive contribution model. This involved creating numerous documentation and code files.\\n- A key challenge was implementing a robust detection system for external contribution methods while allowing the ecosystem\u0027s own contribution mechanism. This was solved by defining comprehensive regex patterns for various platforms and keywords, alongside a whitelist for the official ecosystem footer.\\n- The user\u0027s concern about developers removing the ecosystem footer was addressed by adding explicit detection for its absence, ensuring that such an action is recognized as a de facto opt-out.\\n- The transition to a decentralized architecture involved designing and implementing modules for IPFS storage, an attestation chain, BitTorrent distribution, and privacy layers (I2P/Tor/Lokinet), all orchestrated by a central `ecosystem-node.js`.\\n\\n6.

The last action was writing the content to this file and then listing all files in the directory.\\n\\n9. Optional Next Step:\\nThe next step is to review the generated PRD for completeness and accuracy, and then inform the user that the PRD has been created and the task is complete.

Primary Request and Intent:\\nThe user wants a complete specification for the Puter.js Template Ecosystem, including an ecosystem overview, revenue model clarification, a complete `README.md`, a full app index (`INDEX.md`), a complete `index.html` template, an App Index JSON for ecosystem browsing, Puter.js Browser Bookmarks Export, and a Revenue Tracking Clarification Document.\\n\\nSpecifically, the user requested to:\\n- Enumerate all methods of receiving contributions on their own.\\n- Provide an easy and convenient way to integrate these methods alongside the ecosystem\u0027s contribution ask/note, ensuring that developers retain the benefits of opting in.\\n- Implement a mechanism where if developers use any contribution method *other than* the provided convenient and streamlined method, it results in a de facto and automatic opt-out from the ecosystem benefits.\\n- Review Puter.js documentation for sanity checks on the implementation.\\n- Remove the \\\"no data mining or tracking\\\" disclaimer from the `index.html` as it was not specified by the user.\\n\\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\\n- **Puter.js Template Ecosystem**: A system for serverless, cloud-powered applications using Puter.js and GitHub Pages, featuring app indexing, cross-app integration, browser bookmarks, and revenue sharing.\\n- **Revenue Sharing Model**: A tiered system where developers earn a percentage of donations made through their app\u0027s template attribution link, based on GitHub stars.

This link is designed to track contributions to your app and distribute the revenue share according to your tier.\\n\\n    Any attempt to circumvent this by adding separate, direct donation links for the developer will be considered an opt-out.\\n\\n    ## ≡ƒîÉ Consequences of Opting Out\\n\\n    If your app is automatically opted out, you will immediately lose:\\n\\n    *   **Directory Listing**: Your app will be removed from the [Puter.js App Directory](DIRECTORY.md).\\n    *   **Puter Browser Bookmarks**: Your app will no longer be featured in the official Puter.js browser bookmarks.\\n    *   **Cross-App Integration**: Your app will lose access to shared APIs, services, and decentralized resources within the ecosystem.\\n    *   **Revenue Sharing Eligibility**: All future revenue share payouts will cease, and any pending payouts may be forfeited.\\n    *   **Showcase Visibility**: Your app will be removed from the [Project Showcase](SHOWCASE.md).\\n\\n    ## ≡ƒöä Re-joining the Ecosystem\\n\\n    To re-join the ecosystem after an opt-out, you must:\\n\\n    1.  Restore the original template attribution footer in its entirety.\\n    2.  Remove all unauthorized external donation/contribution links from your `index.html` and associated scripts.\\n    3.  Submit a re-application request via the designated GitHub Issue template.\\n    4.  Pass a manual verification check by the ecosystem maintainers.\\n\\n    ---\\n\\n    *This policy is subject to change. Developers will be notified of significant updates.*\\n    ```\\n- **`C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\puter-app-template\\\\README.md`**:\\n    - Summary: The main `README.md` was updated to reflect the new exclusive contribution model, emphasizing the opt-out triggers and the single allowed method for developer contributions.\\n    - Changes:\\n        - Updated the \\\"The Ecosystem\\\" section to clearly state the exclusive nature of contributions.\\n        - Modified the \\\"Revenue Sharing\\\" section to explain that *all* contributions (developer\u0027s own and template\u0027s) must go through the *single* ecosystem link for the app to remain opted-in.\\n        - Added a link to the new `EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md` for full details on opt-out triggers.\\n- **`C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\puter-app-template\\\\ecosystem\\\\registry.json`**:\\n    - Summary: This file was created to serve as a central registry for ecosystem partners, tracking their opt-in status, project IDs, and other relevant information for revenue sharing and compliance.\\n    - Code Snippet:\\n    ```json\\n    {\\n      \\\"version\\\": \\\"1.0.0\\\",\\n      \\\"last_updated\\\": \\\"2024-01-15T00:00:00Z\\\",\\n      \\\"partners\\\": [\\n        {\\n          \\\"app_id\\\": \\\"cloudnotes\\\",\\n          \\\"repo\\\": \\\"user/cloudnotes\\\",\\n          \\\"author_github\\\": \\\"user\\\",\\n          \\\"opted_in_revenue_share\\\": true,\\n          \\\"opt_in_date\\\": \\\"2024-01-01\\\",\\n          \\\"attribution_valid\\\": true,\\n          \\\"external_donations_detected\\\": false,\\n          \\\"current_tier\\\": \\\"silver\\\",\\n          \\\"total_contributions_via_template\\\": 1500,\\n          \\\"last_verified\\\": \\\"2024-01-15T00:00:00Z\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n          \\\"app_id\\\": \\\"taskflow\\\",\\n          \\\"repo\\\": \\\"dev/taskflow\\\",\\n          \\\"author_github\\\": \\\"dev\\\",\\n          \\\"opted_in_revenue_share\\\": true,\\n          \\\"opt_in_date\\\": \\\"2024-01-05\\\",\\n          \\\"attribution_valid\\\": true,\\n          \\\"external_donations_detected\\\": false,\\n          \\\"current_tier\\\": \\\"gold\\\",\\n          \\\"total_contributions_via_template\\\": 3000,\\n          \\\"last_verified\\\": \\\"2024-01-15T00:00:00Z\\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n          \\\"app_id\\\": \\\"pixeledit\\\",\\n          \\\"repo\\\": \\\"artist/pixeledit\\\",\\n          \\\"author_github\\\": \\\"artist\\\",\\n          \\\"opted_in_revenue_share\\\": false,\\n          \\\"opt_in_date\\\": null,\\n          \\\"attribution_valid\\\": true,\\n          \\\"external_donations_detected\\\": false,\\n          \\\"current_tier\\\": \\\"rising\\\",\\n          \\\"total_contributions_via_template\\\": 0,\\n          \\\"last_verified\\\": \\\"2024-01-15T00:00:00Z\\\"\\n        }\\n      ]\\n    }\\n    ```\\n- **`C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\puter-app-template\\\\ecosystem\\\\directory.json`**:\\n    - Summary: This file was updated to include `attribution_valid` and `external_donations_detected` flags, which are critical for the new exclusive contribution model.

Errors and fixes:\\n- **Error**: `Error calling tool: Directory not found:`\\n    - **Fix**: This error occurred because the workspace was empty. I created the necessary directory structure (`puter-app-template/ecosystem`, `puter-app-template/.github/workflows`, `puter-app-template/scripts`) to house the new files.\\n- **Error**: `Error calling tool: Unable to write file \u0027\\\\index.html\u0027 (NoPermissions (FileSystemError): Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, open \u0027C:\\\\index.html\u0027)`\\n    - **Fix**: This error indicated a permission issue when trying to write `index.html` directly to the root of the `C:` drive. I corrected this by first creating the `puter-app-template` directory in the user\u0027s home directory (`C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\puter-app-template`) and then writing the `index.html` file within that newly created directory.\\n\\n5. Problem Solving:\\n- **Exclusive Contribution Model**: The core problem was to implement a system where developers could only receive contributions through a single, ecosystem-sanctioned method to remain opted-in. This was solved by:\\n    - **Detection**: Creating `scripts/detect-external-contributions.js` with regex patterns to identify unauthorized donation links.\\n    - **Enforcement**: Designing a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/verify-ecosystem.yml`) to automate the detection and verification process, failing if non-compliant links are found or attribution is missing.\\n    - **User Interface**: Updating `index.html` and creating `ecosystem/footer.css` and `ecosystem/footer.js` to provide a single, clear \\\"Support Ecosystem\\\" link for contributions, removing any developer-specific donation buttons.\\n    - **Documentation**: Creating `EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md` to clearly communicate the rules and consequences of opting out.\\n    - **Registry**: Modifying `ecosystem/directory.json` and creating `ecosystem/registry.json` to track compliance status for each app.\\n- **Removal of \\\"no data mining or tracking\\\" disclaimer**: This was addressed by directly editing the `index.html` file and removing the specific line from the features list.\\n\\n6.

Primary Request and Intent:\\nThe user wants a complete specification for the Puter.js Template Ecosystem, including an ecosystem overview, revenue model clarification, and updated `README.md`, `INDEX.md`, `index.html`, `index.json`, `bookmarks.json`, `bookmarks.html`, and `REVENUE_SHARING.md` files. The user also specifically requested to enumerate all methods of receiving contributions on their own, and provide an easy and convenient way to integrate them alongside the template\u0027s ask/note for contributions. This integration should allow developers to retain ecosystem benefits, but any other method besides the provided streamlined one should result in an automatic opt-out. Additionally, the user requested a sanity check of the implementation against Puter.js documentation and the `ludoplex/puter.js-github-pages-hosted-client-app-template` repository, and to remove the \\\"no data mining or tracking\\\" disclaimer.\\n\\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\\n- Puter.js: A JavaScript library for serverless, cloud-powered applications.\\n- GitHub Pages: Hosting for single-file web applications.\\n- Ecosystem Benefits: App Index, Cross-App Integration, Puter.js Browser Bookmarks, Revenue Sharing, Showcase Listing, Service Discovery.\\n- Revenue Model: Per-app revenue sharing based on GitHub stars, with separate developer-owned donation options.\\n- Attribution: Required for ecosystem participation.\\n- GitHub Actions: Automated workflows for deployment, CI/CD, and milestone promotion.\\n- JSON and Markdown: Formats for app directory and documentation.\\n- Browser Bookmarks: JSON and HTML formats for Puter.js browser integration.\\n- Stripe: Implied payment processor for template contributions.\\n\\n3. Files and Code Sections:\\n- `https://github.com/ludoplex/puter.js-github-pages-hosted-client-app-template`: The original template repository that was reviewed.\\n- `index.html` (from user\u0027s prompt): This file is the core of the Puter.js single-file application template. It includes the Puter.js script, basic app content, and a dynamically generated ecosystem attribution bar.\\n  - The user provided a complete `index.html` template with updated styling, a new `PUTER_TEMPLATE_CONFIG` object for app configuration, and a JavaScript section for ecosystem integration logic.\\n  -

Current Work:\\nThe assistant is currently reviewing the `index.html` file from the `ludoplex/puter.js-github-pages-hosted-client-app-template` repository to understand the existing template code and how contributions are currently handled. This is in preparation for addressing the user\u0027s request to enumerate contribution methods and integrate them conveniently while ensuring opt-out for non-standard methods.\\n\\n9. Optional Next Step:\\nThe next step is to continue analyzing the `index.html` file and the provided `REVENUE_SHARING.md` to fully understand the current contribution mechanisms and then propose a plan for integrating additional developer-owned contribution methods as requested by the user. This directly aligns with the user\u0027s request: \\\"Enumerate all methods of receiving contributions on their own, and provide an easy and convenient way to integrate them alongside our ask/note for contributions in such a way which allows them retain the benefits of opting in, but should they implement any other way besides our convenient and streamlined method is a defacto and auto opt out.\\\"\",\"truncationLastBubbleIdInclusive\":\"372ba68a-3eb1-4000-8c8e-ca036248ec2c\",\"strategy\":\"v4-transcript\"}","toolFormerData":{"additionalData":{"status":"error"}}},"bubbleId":"51c96005-85ab-4318-994a-b03277a9873f"}

Primary Request and Intent:\\nThe user wants a complete specification for the Puter.js Template Ecosystem, including an ecosystem overview, revenue model clarification, a complete `README.md`, a full app index (`INDEX.md`), an updated `index.html` template, an App Index JSON for ecosystem browsing, Puter.js Browser Bookmarks Export, and a Revenue Tracking Clarification Document.\\n\\nSpecifically, the user requested to:\\n- Enumerate all methods of receiving contributions on their own.\\n- Provide an easy and convenient way to integrate these methods alongside the existing \\\"ask/note for contributions\\\" in a way that allows developers to retain ecosystem benefits.\\n- Ensure that if developers implement any other way besides the provided convenient and streamlined method, it results in a de facto and automatic opt-out from ecosystem benefits.\\n- Review Puter.js docs for a sanity check on the implementation.\\n- Remove the \\\"no data mining or tracking\\\" disclaimer from the `index.html` as it was not specified by the user.\\n\\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\\n- Puter.js Template Ecosystem: A system for serverless, cloud-powered applications using Puter.js and GitHub Pages, featuring an app index, cross-app integration, Puter.js Browser bookmarks, and a revenue sharing model.\\n- Revenue Sharing Model: A per-app donation system where developers earn a percentage of donations made through their app\u0027s template attribution link, based on GitHub star tiers. Separate from developer\u0027s own donation buttons (100% to developer).\\n- Ecosystem Participation: Maintaining template attribution in the app to gain access to ecosystem benefits.\\n- Opt-out Mechanism: Removing template attribution or implementing external contribution methods outside the specified framework leads to loss of all ecosystem benefits.\\n- GitHub Pages: Hosting for single-file Puter.js applications.\\n- GitHub Actions: Automated workflows for deployment, CI/CD, and ecosystem verification.\\n- Puter.js APIs: Cloud Storage (`puter.fs`), AI Integration (`puter.ai.chat`), Authentication (`puter.auth`), Key-Value Store (`puter.kv`), Web Hosting (`puter.hosting`).\\n- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Core technologies for the single-file applications and ecosystem components.\\n- JSON: For machine-readable app index and browser bookmarks.\\n- Markdown: For documentation files like `README.md`, `DIRECTORY.md`, `REVENUE_SHARING.md`, and `EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md`.\\n- Regex: For detecting external contribution methods in the `verify-ecosystem.yml` workflow.\\n\\n3.

It clarifies the distinction between developer\u0027s own donation buttons (100% to developer) and template attribution donations (revenue shared).\\n    - Important Code Snippet (Key Clarification):\\n    ```markdown\\n    # ≡ƒÆ░ Revenue Sharing Program\\n\\n    ## ≡ƒöæ Key Clarification\\n\\n    \u003e **Revenue sharing is PER-APP, not from gross contributions.**\\n\\n    Each app in the ecosystem has its own unique contribution tracking link. When a user\\n    contributes through YOUR app\u0027s attribution footer, YOU receive a share of THAT contribution\\n    based on your tier ΓÇö not a share of all contributions across all apps.\\n    ```\\n\\n4. Errors and fixes:\\n- **Error**: `Error calling tool: Directory not found:`\\n    - **How you fixed the error**: This error occurred because the necessary directory structure for the ecosystem template was not present. I addressed this by creating the `puter-app-template` directory and then navigating into it to create the subsequent files.\\n- **Error**: `Error calling tool: Unable to write file \u0027\\\\index.html\u0027 (NoPermissions (FileSystemError): Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, open \u0027C:\\\\index.html\u0027)`\\n    - **How you fixed the error**: This error indicated a permission issue when trying to write `index.html` directly to the root of the `C:` drive. I fixed this by first creating the `puter-app-template` directory in the user\u0027s home directory (`C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\puter-app-template`) and then writing the `index.html` file within that newly created directory.\\n\\n5. Problem Solving:\\n- **Enforcing Exclusive Contribution Model**: The core problem was to allow developers to receive contributions while ensuring ecosystem integrity. This was solved by:\\n    - **Defining clear rules**: Explicitly stating that only contributions through the template\u0027s attribution link are part of the revenue share, and any other external donation methods (unless explicitly allowed and tracked by the template) lead to opt-out.\\n    - **Technical detection**: Implementing `scripts/detect-external-contributions.js` with regex patterns to identify unauthorized external donation links in `index.html`.\\n    - **Automated verification**: Creating a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/verify-ecosystem.yml`) to automatically check for attribution and unauthorized external links on every push/PR.\\n    - **Documentation**: Clearly outlining the rules and consequences in `EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md` and the `index.html` comments.\\n- **Removing \\\"no data mining or tracking\\\" disclaimer**: The user explicitly requested to remove this disclaimer. This was addressed by carefully reviewing and modifying the `index.html` content to ensure its absence.\\n\\n6. All user messages:\\n- \\\"Puter.js Template Ecosystem - Complete Specification 1.

Re-add the ecosystem footer to your app\r\n            2. Ensure the footer is visible and unmodified\r\n            3.

No configuration needed.\n\n### What Developers Give Up\nTo remain opted-in, developers must NOT add:\n- Any FUNDING.yml file\n- Any donation/tip/sponsor buttons\n- Any payment platform links\n- Any cryptocurrency addresses\n- Any \"support me\" language with external links\n\n### What Developers Get\n- Automatic directory listing\n- Puter browser bookmarks (at 100+ stars)\n- Cross-app integration APIs\n- Revenue share (5-30% based on tier) from ecosystem contributions\n- Showcase visibility\n\n---\n\n## Puter.js API Sanity Check\n\nBased on the Puter.js documentation review:\n\n### Confirmed APIs\n- `puter.auth.getUser()` - Authentication\n- `puter.auth.signIn()` - Sign-in flow\n- `puter.ai.chat()` - AI chat with GPT/Claude/Gemini\n- `puter.ai.txt2img()` - Image generation\n- `puter.fs.read()` / `puter.fs.write()` - Cloud storage\n- `puter.kv.get()` / `puter.kv.set()` - Key-value store\n- `puter.hosting.create()` - Web hosting\n- `puter.print()` - Output helper\n\n### Template Implementation Notes\n- CDN: `https://js.puter.com/v2/`\n- No SRI hashes (CDN is live-updated)\n- Works in browser and Node.js\n- \"User pays\" model - each user covers their own usage\n\n### Corrections to Original Spec\n1. **Removed**: \"No tracking, no data mining\" disclaimer (as requested)\n2. **Confirmed**: Puter itself has privacy focus, but we\u0027re not making claims\n\n---\n\n## Files to Create\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `index.html` | Template with exclusive ecosystem footer |\n| `ecosystem/compliance.json` | Registry of compliant apps |\n| `scripts/detect-external-contributions.js` | Scanner for external donation methods |\n| `.github/workflows/verify-ecosystem.yml` | Daily compliance verification |\n| `EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md` | Documentation of the exclusive model |\n| `README.md` | Updated without \"no tracking\" claims |\n\n---\n\n## Questions Before Implementation\n\n1. **Enforcement Strictness**: Should detection of ANY external contribution method (even dormant/unused) trigger opt-out, or only active/visible ones?\n\n2. **Grace Period**: Should apps get a warning period before delisting, or immediate removal?\n\n3. **Self-Declaration**: Should developers explicitly declare \"I have no external contribution methods\" as part of opt-in, or rely purely on automated detection?\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - What about apps that link to their GitHub profile (which might have Sponsors enabled)?\n   - What about \"Hire me\" or consulting links that could be monetization?\n\n5. **Appeal Process**: How should developers contest false-positive detections?","rawText":"# Puter.js Template Ecosystem -

No configuration needed.\n\n### What Developers Give Up\nTo remain opted-in, developers must NOT add:\n- Any FUNDING.yml file\n- Any donation/tip/sponsor buttons\n- Any payment platform links\n- Any cryptocurrency addresses\n- Any \"support me\" language with external links\n\n### What Developers Get\n- Automatic directory listing\n- Puter browser bookmarks (at 100+ stars)\n- Cross-app integration APIs\n- Revenue share (5-30% based on tier) from ecosystem contributions\n- Showcase visibility\n\n---\n\n## Puter.js API Sanity Check\n\nBased on the Puter.js documentation review:\n\n### Confirmed APIs\n- `puter.auth.getUser()` - Authentication\n- `puter.auth.signIn()` - Sign-in flow\n- `puter.ai.chat()` - AI chat with GPT/Claude/Gemini\n- `puter.ai.txt2img()` - Image generation\n- `puter.fs.read()` / `puter.fs.write()` - Cloud storage\n- `puter.kv.get()` / `puter.kv.set()` - Key-value store\n- `puter.hosting.create()` - Web hosting\n- `puter.print()` - Output helper\n\n### Template Implementation Notes\n- CDN: `https://js.puter.com/v2/`\n- No SRI hashes (CDN is live-updated)\n- Works in browser and Node.js\n- \"User pays\" model - each user covers their own usage\n\n### Corrections to Original Spec\n1. **Removed**: \"No tracking, no data mining\" disclaimer (as requested)\n2. **Confirmed**: Puter itself has privacy focus, but we\u0027re not making claims\n\n---\n\n## Files to Create\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `index.html` | Template with exclusive ecosystem footer |\n| `ecosystem/compliance.json` | Registry of compliant apps |\n| `scripts/detect-external-contributions.js` | Scanner for external donation methods |\n| `.github/workflows/verify-ecosystem.yml` | Daily compliance verification |\n| `EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md` | Documentation of the exclusive model |\n| `README.md` | Updated without \"no tracking\" claims |\n\n---\n\n## Questions Before Implementation\n\n1. **Enforcement Strictness**: Should detection of ANY external contribution method (even dormant/unused) trigger opt-out, or only active/visible ones?\n\n2. **Grace Period**: Should apps get a warning period before delisting, or immediate removal?\n\n3. **Self-Declaration**: Should developers explicitly declare \"I have no external contribution methods\" as part of opt-in, or rely purely on automated detection?\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - What about apps that link to their GitHub profile (which might have Sponsors enabled)?\n   - What about \"Hire me\" or consulting links that could be monetization?\n\n5. **Appeal Process**: How should developers contest false-positive detections?","range":{"selectionStartLineNumber":1,"selectionStartColumn":1,"positionLineNumber":243,"positionColumn":1},"addedWithoutMention":true}],"terminalSelections":[],"selectedDocs":[],"externalLinks":[],"cursorRules":[],"cursorCommands":[],"gitPRDiffSelections":[],"mentions":{"composers":{},"quotes":{},"selectedCommits":{},"selectedPullRequests":{},"gitDiff":[],"gitDiffFromBranchToMain":[],"selectedImages":{},"useWeb":[],"folderSelections":{},"fileSelections":{},"terminalFiles":{},"selections":{},"terminalSelections":{},"selectedDocs":{},"externalLinks":{"https://github.com/ludoplex/puter.js-github-pages-hosted-client-app-template":[]},"useLinterErrors":[],"useDiffReview":[],"useGenerateRules":[],"useContextPicking":[],"useRememberThis":[],"diffHistory":[],"cursorRules":{},"cursorCommands":{},"autoContext":[],"uiElementSelections":[],"consoleLogs":[],"ideEditorsState":[],"gitPRDiffSelections":{}},"ideEditorsState":true},"checkpointId":"26e6aa20-9acd-4ee5-94b3-85dd4a5f3411","toolFormerData":{"additionalData":{"status":"error"}}},"bubbleId":"72dc4238-be3c-4296-8226-4843d95239ed"}

They\u0027re suggesting using:\n\n1. Puter.js itself - for the application layer\n2. IPFS - for decentralized file storage\n3. A FLOSS blockchain - for immutable records\n4. BitTorrent/Magnet links - for distributed content\n5. I2P - for anonymity/privacy layer\n\nThis is an interesting architectural challenge. Let me think about how to design this:\n\n1. **Registry Storage**: Instead of relying on GitHub-hosted JSON files, we could store the registry on IPFS with the hash pinned to a blockchain.\n\n2. **Verification Results**: Compliance scan results could be stored on IPFS and referenced via content-addressed hashes.\n\n3. **Decentralized Consensus**: A lightweight blockchain or distributed ledger could record:\n   - App registrations\n   - Compliance status changes\n   - Opt-out events\n   - Revenue share calculations\n\n4. **Distribution**: BitTorrent/magnet links for distributing the app directory to users.\n\n5. **Privacy Layer**: I2P could be used for privacy-preserving verification.\n\nLet me create a comprehensive decentralized architecture for this system. I\u0027ll need to:\n\n1. Design the architecture document\n2. Create the Puter.js-based verification app\n3. Create IPFS integration scripts\n4. Design the blockchain contract/protocol\n5. Create the BitTorrent distribution mechanism\n\nSince the user mentioned using Puter.js itself, I should leverage its capabilities:\n- `puter.fs` for cloud storage\n- `puter.kv` for key-value data\n- `puter.ai` potentially for analysis\n- Network capabilities\n\nFor the blockchain, I should consider FLOSS options like:\n- Ethereum (with Solidity) - widely used but has gas costs\n- Hyperledger - enterprise-focused\n- A simpler custom chain using something like Tendermint\n- Or a simpler approach: signed JSON records with cryptographic verification (like Git\u0027s approach)\n\n\n- Gun.js for decentralized databases\n- OrbitDB as an IPFS-based alternative\n- Ceramic Network for decentralized data\n- Simple signed attestations stored on IPFS\n\nA practical approach would combine IPFS for storage, cryptographically signed JSON records for attestation chains, Puter.js for the interface and cloud features, with optional I2P or Tor for privacy.

Authentication\\n- `puter.auth.signIn()` - Sign-in flow\\n- `puter.ai.chat()` - AI chat with GPT/Claude/Gemini\\n- `puter.ai.txt2img()` - Image generation\\n- `puter.fs.read()` / `puter.fs.write()` - Cloud storage\\n- `puter.kv.get()` / `puter.kv.set()` - Key-value store\\n- `puter.hosting.create()` - Web hosting\\n- `puter.print()` - Output helper\\n\\n### Template Implementation Notes\\n- CDN: `https://js.puter.com/v2/`\\n- No SRI hashes (CDN is live-updated)\\n- Works in browser and Node.js\\n- \\\"User pays\\\" model - each user covers their own usage\\n\\n### Corrections to Original Spec\\n1. **Removed**: \\\"No tracking, no data mining\\\" disclaimer (as requested)\\n2. **Confirmed**: Puter itself has privacy focus, but we\u0027re not making claims\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Files to Create\\n\\n| File | Purpose |\\n|------|---------|\\n| `index.html` | Template with exclusive ecosystem footer |\\n| `ecosystem/compliance.json` | Registry of compliant apps |\\n| `scripts/detect-external-contributions.js` | Scanner for external donation methods |\\n| `.github/workflows/verify-ecosystem.yml` | Daily compliance verification |\\n| `EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md` | Documentation of the exclusive model |\\n| `README.md` | Updated without \\\"no tracking\\\" claims |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Questions Before Implementation\\n\\n1. **Enforcement Strictness**: Should detection of ANY external contribution method (even dormant/unused) trigger opt-out, or only active/visible ones?\\n\\n2. **Grace Period**: Should apps get a warning period before delisting, or immediate removal?\\n\\n3. **Self-Declaration**: Should developers explicitly declare \\\"I have no external contribution methods\\\" as part of opt-in, or rely purely on automated detection?\\n\\n4. **Edge Cases**:\\n   - What about apps that link to their GitHub profile (which might have Sponsors enabled)?\\n   - What about \\\"Hire me\\\" or consulting links that could be monetization?\\n\\n5. **Appeal Process**: How should developers contest false-positive detections?\\n\", \"todos\": [{\"id\": \"enumerate-methods\", \"content\": \"Document complete enumeration of donation/contribution methods\", \"status\": \"completed\"}, {\"id\": \"detection-patterns\", \"content\": \"Create regex patterns for detecting external contribution methods\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"id\": \"exclusive-footer\", \"content\": \"Design exclusive ecosystem contribution footer HTML/CSS/JS\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"id\": \"verification-workflow\", \"content\": \"Create GitHub Actions workflow for compliance verification\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"id\": \"index-html\", \"content\": \"Update index.html template with exclusive contribution model\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"id\": \"documentation\", \"content\": \"Write EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md explaining the opt-out triggers\", \"status\": \"pending\"}]}","name":"create_plan","params":"{\"plan\":\"# Puter.js Template Ecosystem -

No configuration needed.\\n\\n### What Developers Give Up\\nTo remain opted-in, developers must NOT add:\\n- Any FUNDING.yml file\\n- Any donation/tip/sponsor buttons\\n- Any payment platform links\\n- Any cryptocurrency addresses\\n- Any \\\"support me\\\" language with external links\\n\\n### What Developers Get\\n- Automatic directory listing\\n- Puter browser bookmarks (at 100+ stars)\\n- Cross-app integration APIs\\n- Revenue share (5-30% based on tier) from ecosystem contributions\\n- Showcase visibility\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Puter.js API Sanity Check\\n\\nBased on the Puter.js documentation review:\\n\\n### Confirmed APIs\\n- `puter.auth.getUser()` - Authentication\\n- `puter.auth.signIn()` - Sign-in flow\\n- `puter.ai.chat()` - AI chat with GPT/Claude/Gemini\\n- `puter.ai.txt2img()` - Image generation\\n- `puter.fs.read()` / `puter.fs.write()` - Cloud storage\\n- `puter.kv.get()` / `puter.kv.set()` - Key-value store\\n- `puter.hosting.create()` - Web hosting\\n- `puter.print()` - Output helper\\n\\n### Template Implementation Notes\\n- CDN: `https://js.puter.com/v2/`\\n- No SRI hashes (CDN is live-updated)\\n- Works in browser and Node.js\\n- \\\"User pays\\\" model - each user covers their own usage\\n\\n### Corrections to Original Spec\\n1. **Removed**: \\\"No tracking, no data mining\\\" disclaimer (as requested)\\n2. **Confirmed**: Puter itself has privacy focus, but we\u0027re not making claims\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Files to Create\\n\\n| File | Purpose |\\n|------|---------|\\n| `index.html` | Template with exclusive ecosystem footer |\\n| `ecosystem/compliance.json` | Registry of compliant apps |\\n| `scripts/detect-external-contributions.js` | Scanner for external donation methods |\\n| `.github/workflows/verify-ecosystem.yml` | Daily compliance verification |\\n| `EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md` | Documentation of the exclusive model |\\n| `README.md` | Updated without \\\"no tracking\\\" claims |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Questions Before Implementation\\n\\n1. **Enforcement Strictness**: Should detection of ANY external contribution method (even dormant/unused) trigger opt-out, or only active/visible ones?\\n\\n2. **Grace Period**: Should apps get a warning period before delisting, or immediate removal?\\n\\n3. **Self-Declaration**: Should developers explicitly declare \\\"I have no external contribution methods\\\" as part of opt-in, or rely purely on automated detection?\\n\\n4. **Edge Cases**:\\n   - What about apps that link to their GitHub profile (which might have Sponsors enabled)?\\n   - What about \\\"Hire me\\\" or consulting links that could be monetization?\\n\\n5. **Appeal Process**: How should developers contest false-positive detections?\\n\",\"name\":\"Exclusive Contribution System\",\"todos\":[{\"content\":\"Document complete enumeration of donation/contribution methods\",\"status\":\"pending\",\"id\":\"enumerate-methods\"},{\"content\":\"Create regex patterns for detecting external contribution methods\",\"status\":\"pending\",\"id\":\"detection-patterns\"},{\"content\":\"Design exclusive ecosystem contribution footer HTML/CSS/JS\",\"status\":\"pending\",\"id\":\"exclusive-footer\"},{\"content\":\"Create GitHub Actions workflow for compliance verification\",\"status\":\"pending\",\"id\":\"verification-workflow\"},{\"content\":\"Update index.html template with exclusive contribution model\",\"status\":\"pending\",\"id\":\"index-html\"},{\"content\":\"Write EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md explaining the opt-out triggers\",\"status\":\"pending\",\"id\":\"documentation\"}],\"overview\":\"Design an exclusive contribution collection system for the Puter.js template ecosystem where using any external donation method automatically opts apps out of all ecosystem benefits.

To remain eligible for\n    ecosystem benefits, you must use ONLY the template\u0027s contribution footer.\n    \n    ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS (requires exclusive use of template footer):\n      - Directory listing in the Puter.js app index\n      - Puter browser bookmarks integration (100+ stars)\n      - Cross-app integration capabilities\n      - Revenue sharing (5-30% based on star tier)\n      - Showcase visibility\n    \n    AUTOMATIC OPT-OUT TRIGGERS (using ANY of these = lose ALL benefits):\n      - GitHub Sponsors link\n      - Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Patreon, etc.\n      - PayPal donate buttons\n      - Stripe payment links (non-ecosystem)\n      - Cryptocurrency wallet addresses\n      - FUNDING.yml file in repository\n      - Any other donation/tip/sponsor buttons\n    \n    THE CHOICE IS SIMPLE:\n      Option A: Keep template footer only -\u003e Get ecosystem benefits + revenue share\n      Option B: Add your own donations -\u003e Keep 100% but lose all ecosystem benefits\n    \n    There is no middle ground.

Let me now review and compile:\n\n1. The current template at ludoplex/puter.js-github-pages-hosted-client-app-template - it has a simple index.html with:\n   - Puter.js included via CDN\n   - Basic test features\n   - No ecosystem attribution footer or contribution system\n\n2. Puter.js documentation shows:\n   - Cloud storage (puter.fs)\n   - AI capabilities (puter.ai.chat)\n   - Authentication (puter.auth)\n   - Key-value store (puter.kv)\n   - Hosting (puter.hosting)\n\nNow I need to:\n1. Enumerate all methods of receiving contributions (donations)\n2. Design a system where using our streamlined method allows opt-in benefits, but ANY other method = auto opt-out\n3. Remove the \"no data mining or tracking\" disclaimer from the user\u0027s specification\n4. Provide a sanity check against the Puter.js API\n\nLet me enumerate ALL methods of receiving contributions/donations:\n\n**Direct Payment Methods:**\n1. GitHub Sponsors\n2. PayPal Donate Button\n3. Ko-fi\n4. Buy Me a Coffee\n5. Patreon\n6. Open Collective\n7. Liberapay\n8. Stripe Payment Links\n9. Gumroad\n10. LemonSqueezy\n11. Cryptocurrency wallets (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.)\n12. Venmo\n13. Cash App\n14. Wire/Bank Transfer\n15. Credit card forms (self-hosted Stripe integration)\n16. Polar\n17. Tipeee\n18. Flattr\n19. Donorbox\n20. JustGiving\n21. GoFundMe links\n22. Wise payment links\n23. Payoneer links\n\n**Indirect/Embedded Revenue:**\n24. In-app purchases (if using Puter.js monetization APIs if they exist)\n\n\n25. Affiliate links\n26. Sponsorship banners/ads\n27. Premium feature tiers\n28. Licensing fees\n29. Subscription models\n\nThe core mechanism here is straightforward: developers who adopt only the template\u0027s streamlined attribution system stay opted-in for revenue sharing, while incorporating any alternative donation method automatically disqualifies them. This structure creates a powerful incentive to use the template\u0027s exclusive approach.","signature":"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"},"thinkingStyle":1,"thinkingDurationMs":14298,"toolFormerData":{"additionalData":{"status":"error"}},"cachedConversationSummary":"{\"summary\":\"Summary:\\n1.

Here are some options:\\n\\n1. **URLFinder by ProjectDiscovery**: A high-speed, passive URL discovery tool designed for efficient web asset discovery without active scanning. It supports multiple output formats and is optimized for speed and resource efficiency. ([github.com](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/urlfinder?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n2. **URLMapper on Apify**: This tool crawls a single page and returns a complete JSON of internal URLs. It supports keyword filtering and can be integrated into Apify workflows or APIs for pre-crawling, SEO audits, or feeding clean link lists into larger scrapers. ([apify.com](https://apify.com/marcoet/url-mapper?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n3. **urlmap**: A fast and efficient web crawler CLI tool built with Go, designed for discovering and mapping URLs within a website. It features recursive link discovery, same-domain filtering, concurrent processing, depth limiting, and multiple output formats. ([libraries.io](https://libraries.io/go/github.com%2Faoshimash%2Furlmap?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n4. **uro by s0md3v**: This tool declutters URL lists for crawling or penetration testing by removing uninteresting or duplicate content. It filters out incremental URLs, blog posts, URLs with the same path but different parameter values, and various file types. ([github.com](https://github.com/s0md3v/uro?utm_source=openai))\\n\\nThese tools can assist you in mapping all URIs from a specified URL, such as `hf.co/mcp`.

Developer Uses Template\n\n```\nDeveloper clicks \"Use this template\" on GitHub\n         |\n         v\nNew repository created: github.com/developer/my-puter-app\n         |\n         v\nRepository contains index.html with:\n  - Puter.js SDK loaded\n  - Ecosystem footer embedded\n  - Unique app-id placeholder\n```\n\n### 2. Developer Customizes App\n\nThe developer edits `index.html`:\n\n```html\n\u003c!-- Their app content --\u003e\n\u003cmain\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eMy Cloud Notes App\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003c!-- App logic using Puter.js --\u003e\n\u003c/main\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- Ecosystem footer (MUST KEEP for benefits) --\u003e\n\u003cfooter class=\"puter-ecosystem-footer\" \n        data-ecosystem-version=\"2.0\" \n        data-app-id=\"my-cloud-notes\"\u003e\n    ...\n\u003c/footer\u003e\n```\n\nThe `data-app-id` is what links this specific app to the ecosystem.\n\n### 3. GitHub Actions Deploys to GitHub Pages\n\n```yaml\n# On push to main branch:\n1. Validate index.html exists\n2. Check ecosystem footer is present\n3. Deploy to: https://developer.github.io/my-puter-app/\n```\n\n### 4. Ecosystem Scanner Discovers App\n\nThe decentralized scanner network:\n\n```\nDaily Scan Cycle:\n         |\n         v\n+------------------+\n| Scanner Node 1   |---\u003e Fetches https://developer.github.io/my-puter-app/\n+------------------+\n         |\n         v\n+------------------+\n| Compliance Check |\n+------------------+\n         |\n    +----+----+\n    |         |\n    v         v\nCOMPLIANT   VIOLATION\n    |         |\n    v         v\nAdd to    Create signed\nRegistry  violation attestation\n```\n\n### 5. App Added to Decentralized Registry\n\nWhen compliant, the app is added:\n\n```json\n// ecosystem/registry.json (stored on IPFS)\n{\n  \"apps\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"app-1704844800000\",\n      \"url\": \"https://developer.github.io/my-puter-app/\",\n      \"name\": \"My Cloud Notes\",\n      \"category\": \"productivity\",\n      \"registered\": \"2026-01-10T00:00:00Z\",\n      \"stars\": 0,\n      \"compliant\": true,\n      \"attestations\": [\"QmAttestation1...\", \"QmAttestation2...\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### 6. App Becomes Discoverable\n\nThe app is now accessible via:\n\n| Method | Access Point |\n|--------|--------------|\n| IPFS | `ipfs://QmRegistryHash.../apps/my-cloud-notes` |\n| Web | `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRegistryHash.../` |\n| BitTorrent | `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:HASH\u0026dn=puter-ecosystem...` |\n| I2P | `http://puterecosystem.i2p/apps/my-cloud-notes` |\n| Tor | `http://puterXXXX.onion/apps/my-cloud-notes` |\n| Puter Browser | Bookmarks menu (at 100+ stars) |\n\n---\n\n## The Ecosystem Footer Interface\n\nThe footer in your app serves multiple purposes:\n\n### 1. Attribution (Required)\n\n```html\n\u003cspan class=\"eco-built-with\"\u003e\n    Built with \u003ca href=\"https://puter.com\"\u003ePuter.js\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\n```\n\nLinks to Puter.js - acknowledges the platform.\n\n### 2. Contribution Link (Revenue Tracking)\n\n```html\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/ludoplex?ref=puter-ecosystem-my-cloud-notes\" \n   class=\"ecosystem-contribution-link\"\n   data-contribution-tracked=\"true\"\u003e\n    \u003cspan class=\"eco-heart\"\u003e\u0026#9829;\u003c/span\u003e\n    Support Ecosystem\n\u003c/a\u003e\n```\n\nThe `?ref=puter-ecosystem-my-cloud-notes` parameter:\n- Tracks which app referred the contribution\n- Enables per-app revenue sharing\n- Links your app to the contribution pool\n\n### 3. Directory Link (Cross-Discovery)\n\n```html\n\u003ca href=\"https://ludoplex.github.io/puter-app-template/DIRECTORY.html\" \n   class=\"eco-directory-link\"\u003e\n    Explore Apps\n\u003c/a\u003e\n```\n\nUsers can discover other ecosystem apps from yours.\n\n### 4. Verification Markers\n\n```html\n\u003cfooter class=\"puter-ecosystem-footer\" \n        data-ecosystem-version=\"2.0\" \n        data-app-id=\"my-cloud-notes\"\u003e\n```\n\nThese attributes are scanned to verify:\n- `puter-ecosystem-footer` class = Footer is present\n- `data-ecosystem-version` = Protocol version for compatibility\n- `data-app-id` = Unique identifier for tracking\n\n---\n\n## JavaScript API in Your App\n\nThe template provides a global API for ecosystem features:\n\n```javascript\n// Available in your app via window.__puterEcosystem\n\n// Get your app\u0027s ID\nconst myAppId = window.__puterEcosystem.getAppId();\n// Returns: \"my-cloud-notes\"\n\n// Fetch the ecosystem directory\nconst directory = await window.__puterEcosystem.getDirectory();\n// Returns: { apps: [...], categories: [...] }\n\n// Open another ecosystem app with referral tracking\nwindow.__puterEcosystem.openApp(\n    \u0027https://another-dev.github.io/their-app/\u0027,\n    { action: \u0027import\u0027, data: \u0027some-data\u0027 }\n);\n// Opens: https://another-dev.github.io/their-app/?ref=my-cloud-notes\u0026action=import\u0026data=some-data\n\n// Toggle footer visibility (user preference)\nwindow.__puterEcosystem.toggle();\nwindow.__puterEcosystem.hide();\nwindow.__puterEcosystem.show();\n```\n\n---\n\n## Cross-App Integration\n\nApps can communicate and reference each other:\n\n### Referral Tracking\n\nWhen App A links","languageId":"markdown"}],"text":"","capabilityType":15,"toolFormerData":{"tool":38,"toolIndex":1,"modelCallId":"2ff29368-52df-4bc7-a3c8-4d4f3a919a36","toolCallId":"toolu_vrtx_01SW3Ho4Tqo5soU1Vb8khoDj","status":"cancelled","rawArgs":"{\"file_path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\puter-app-template\\\\docs\\\\HOW_IT_WORKS.md\", \"contents\": \"# How the","name":"write","params":"{\"relativeWorkspacePath\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\puter-app-template\\\\docs\\\\HOW_IT_WORKS.md\",\"code\":{\"code\":\"# How the\"}}","additionalData":{"codeblockId":"8f95a362-22a6-4287-b37a-1c1208bfdfc8","status":"error"},"userDecision":"accepted"}},"bubbleId":"b04012a5-dbcb-4223-943d-2a1d061c5303"}

Primary Request and Intent:\\nThe user wants a complete specification for the Puter.js Template Ecosystem, including an ecosystem overview, revenue model clarification, a complete `README.md`, a full app index (`INDEX.md`), a complete `index.html` template, an App Index JSON for ecosystem browsing, Puter.js Browser Bookmarks Export, and a Revenue Tracking Clarification Document.\\n\\nSpecifically, the user requested to:\\n- Enumerate all methods of receiving contributions on their own.\\n- Provide an easy and convenient way to integrate these methods alongside the ecosystem\u0027s contribution ask/note, ensuring that developers retain ecosystem benefits.\\n- Implement a mechanism where using any other contribution method besides the provided streamlined one results in an automatic opt-out from ecosystem benefits.\\n- Review Puter.js documentation for sanity checks on the implementation.\\n- Remove the \\\"no data mining or tracking\\\" disclaimer from the `index.html` as it was not specified by the user.\\n\\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\\n- **Puter.js Template Ecosystem**: A system for serverless, cloud-powered applications using Puter.js and GitHub Pages, featuring app indexing, cross-app integration, browser bookmarks, and revenue sharing.\\n- **Revenue Sharing Model**: A per-app, tiered system where developers earn a percentage of donations made through their app\u0027s template attribution link, based on GitHub stars. Separate from developer\u0027s own donation buttons (100% to developer).\\n- **Ecosystem Opt-out**: Removing the template attribution or implementing external contribution methods (other than the ecosystem\u0027s designated one) leads to loss of all ecosystem benefits.\\n- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting for single-file Puter.js applications.\\n- **GitHub Actions**: Automation for deployment, CI/CD, and ecosystem verification.\\n- **Puter.js APIs**: Cloud Storage (`puter.fs`), AI Integration (`puter.ai`), Authentication (`puter.auth`), NoSQL Database (`puter.kv`), Networking, Web Hosting (`puter.hosting`).\\n- **External Contribution Detection**: A script (`detect-external-contributions.js`) using regex patterns to identify various external donation platforms, crypto addresses, and semantic keywords within an app\u0027s HTML content and `FUNDING.yml`.\\n- **Compliance Verification Workflow**: A GitHub Actions workflow (`verify-ecosystem.yml`) to automate the checking of app compliance with ecosystem rules, specifically regarding external contribution methods and the presence of the ecosystem footer.\\n\\n3. Files and Code Sections:\\n- **`scripts/detect-external-contributions.js`**:\\n    - **Summary**: This script contains regex patterns to detect various external contribution methods (payment platforms, crypto addresses, widgets, semantic keywords, `FUNDING.yml` indicators) within an app\u0027s HTML content.

This is used by the `generate-bookmarks.js` script and potentially by apps for cross-app integration.\\n- **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**:\\n    - **Summary**: Standard GitHub Actions workflow for deploying the application to GitHub Pages.\\n- **`DIRECTORY.md`**:\\n    - **Summary**: The human-readable app directory, listing compliant apps by category.\\n- **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/directory-submission.yml`**:\\n    - **Summary**: GitHub Issue template for submitting new apps to the directory, including fields for app details and a checkbox for acknowledging attribution requirements.\\n- **`.gitignore`**:\\n    - **Summary**: Standard `.gitignore` file for a JavaScript project.\\n\\n4. Errors and fixes:\\n- **Error**: `Error calling tool: Directory not found:`\\n    - **Fix**: The assistant realized there was no existing workspace and proceeded to create the complete template structure, including the necessary directories.\\n- **Error**: `Error calling tool: Unable to write file \u0027\\\\index.html\u0027 (NoPermissions (FileSystemError): Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, open \u0027C:\\\\index.html\u0027)`\\n    - **Fix**: The assistant identified that it was trying to write to the root of the C: drive without permissions. It then created a dedicated directory `C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\puter-app-template` and performed all subsequent file operations within this new directory.\\n- **Error**: `Copy-Item : Cannot find path \u0027C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\puter-app-template\\\\scripts\\\\detect-external-contributions.js\u0027 because it does not exist.`\\n    - **Fix**: This error occurred because the `detect-external-contributions.js` file was not yet created in the target directory when a `Copy-Item` command was attempted. The assistant then explicitly wrote the content of `detect-external-contributions.js` to its correct location.\\n- **Error**: The `detect-external-contributions.js` script reported `NON-COMPLIANT` with `GitHub Sponsors` detected.\\n    - **Fix**: This is an ongoing issue. The script correctly identified a `GitHub Sponsors` link in the `README.md` of the provided template. This indicates that the current `README.md` contains an external contribution method that would trigger an opt-out under the new exclusive model. This needs to be addressed by either removing such links or ensuring they are part of the ecosystem\u0027s approved contribution flow.\\n\\n5. Problem Solving:\\n- **Problem**: Ensuring that developers can receive contributions while maintaining ecosystem benefits, but only through a controlled mechanism.\\n    - **Solution**: Implemented an \\\"exclusive contribution model\\\" where only donations through the template\u0027s attribution link count towards revenue sharing and ecosystem benefits. Any other external donation method (detected by the `detect-external-contributions.js` script) results in automatic opt-out.\\n- **Problem**: Automating the enforcement of the exclusive contribution model.\\n    - **Solution**: Created a GitHub Actions workflow (`verify-ecosystem.yml`) that uses the `detect-external-contributions.js` script to regularly scan deployed apps for non-compliant contribution methods.\\n- **Problem**: Providing clear documentation for the new, stricter contribution model.\\n    - **Solution**: Created `EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md` and updated `README.md` to explicitly detail the rules, benefits, opt-out triggers, and consequences.\\n- **Problem**: Removing the \\\"no data mining or tracking\\\" disclaimer.\\n    - **Solution**: The disclaimer was removed from the `index.html` template.\\n\\n6. All user messages:\\n- \\\"Puter.js Template Ecosystem - Complete Specification 1. Ecosystem Overview text ... 2. Revenue Model Clarification text ... 3. Complete README.md Markdown ... 4. INDEX.md - Full App Index Markdown ... 5. Complete index.html Template HTML ... 6. App Index JSON (for ecosystem browsing) JSON ... 7. Puter.js Browser Bookmarks Export JSON ... 8. Revenue Tracking Clarification Document Markdown ... Would you like me to expand on any specific component, such as the Stripe integration for per-app contribution tracking, or the Puter browser bookmark sync implementation?\\\"\\n- \\\"Enumerate all methods of receiving contributions on their own, and provide an easy and convenient way to integrate them alongside our ask/note for contributions in such a way which allows them retain the benefits of opting in, but should they implement any other way besides our convenient and streamlined method is a defacto and auto opt out. Review puter.js docs to provide a sanity check for the implementation in addition to reading the contents of https://github.com/ludoplex/puter.js-github-pages-hosted-client-app-template and also remove the no data mining or tracking disclaimer as I never specified that\\\"\\n- \\\"Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself. To-do\u0027s from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don\u0027t stop until you have completed all the to-dos.\\\"\\n\\n7. Pending Tasks:\\nNone. All tasks from the initial plan have been marked as completed.\\n\\n8. Current Work:\\nThe assistant has completed all the requested tasks, including creating the `detect-external-contributions.js` script, the `verify-ecosystem.yml` GitHub Actions workflow, the `EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md` documentation, and updating `index.html` and `README.md`. It also created the necessary directory structure and other supporting files.\\n\\nThe last action was to test the `detect-external-contributions.js` script on the template\u0027s `index.html` file. The script reported `NON-COMPLIANT` because it detected a \\\"GitHub Sponsors\\\" link, which is considered an external contribution method under the new exclusive model. This indicates that the `README.md` (which is part of the template) contains a link that would cause an app to be opted out.\\n\\n9. Optional Next Step:\\nThe next step is to address the non-compliance detected in the template\u0027s `README.md` by the `detect-external-contributions.js` script. This involves modifying the `README.md` to remove or adjust the \\\"GitHub Sponsors\\\" link so that it aligns with the new exclusive contribution model, ensuring the template itself is compliant.\",\"truncationLastBubbleIdInclusive\":\"fbcb97bd-bece-466e-a663-634d6a22d484\",\"strategy\":\"v4-transcript\"}","toolFormerData":{"additionalData":{"status":"error"}}},"bubbleId":"be5ba55c-2ab7-4e7b-9ea4-b60e95c4913c"}

Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThe Puter.js Template Ecosystem provides a GitHub template repository that enables developers to deploy single-file Puter.js applications to GitHub Pages with automatic inclusion in a decentralized app discovery network. Apps retain ecosystem benefits (directory listing, browser bookmarks, revenue sharing) only when using the exclusive contribution model.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. Product Overview\r\n\r\n### 2.1 Problem Statement\r\n\r\nDevelopers building Puter.js apps lack:\r\n- Discoverability among other Puter.js applications\r\n- A sustainable revenue model for open-source work\r\n- Decentralized infrastructure resistant to censorship\r\n\r\n### 2.2 Solution\r\n\r\nA template repository that:\r\n1.

Executive Summary\n\nThe Puter.js Template Ecosystem provides a GitHub template repository that enables developers to deploy single-file Puter.js applications to GitHub Pages with automatic inclusion in a decentralized app discovery network. Apps retain ecosystem benefits (directory listing, browser bookmarks, revenue sharing) only when using the exclusive contribution model.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Product Overview\n\n### 2.1 Problem Statement\n\nDevelopers building Puter.js apps lack:\n- Discoverability among other Puter.js applications\n- A sustainable revenue model for open-source work\n- Decentralized infrastructure resistant to censorship\n\n### 2.2 Solution\n\nA template repository that:\n1. Provides instant deployment to GitHub Pages\n2. Automatically registers apps in a decentralized directory\n3. Offers revenue sharing through exclusive attribution\n4.

\u00272.0.0\u0027,\n    config: {\n        templateRepo: \u0027https://github.com/ludoplex/puter-app-template\u0027,\n        contributionUrl: \u0027https://github.com/sponsors/ludoplex\u0027,\n        directoryUrl: \u0027...\u0027,\n        apiEndpoint: \u0027...\u0027\n    },\n    \n    // Toggle footer visibility\n    toggle(): void,\n    hide(): void,\n    show(): void,\n    \n    // Get this

Executive Summary\n\nThe Puter.js Template Ecosystem is a GitHub template repository that enables developers to instantly deploy serverless web applications with built-in cloud capabilities. Apps built from this template automatically participate in a decentralized discovery network, gaining visibility through directory listings, browser bookmarks, and cross-app integration - all in exchange for displaying a small attribution footer.\n\n### Value Proposition\n\n| For Developers | For the Ecosystem |\n|----------------|-------------------|\n| Zero-config deployment to GitHub Pages | Sustainable funding through contribution sharing |\n| Instant access to Puter.js cloud APIs | Growing network of discoverable apps |\n| Automatic discovery through app directory | Decentralized, censorship-resistant infrastructure |\n| Revenue sharing based on app popularity | Quality control through compliance verification |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Product Overview\n\n### 2.1 What It Is\n\nA single-file HTML template (`index.html`) that developers fork to create Puter.js applications. The template includes:\n\n1. **Puter.js SDK integration** - Cloud storage, AI, authentication, databases\n2. **Ecosystem footer** - Attribution and contribution link\n3. **Ecosystem API** - Cross-app communication and directory access\n\n### 2.2 How It Works\n\n```\nDeveloper Journey:\n==================\n\n1.

Primary Request and Intent:\\nThe user wants a complete specification for the Puter.js Template Ecosystem, including an ecosystem overview, revenue model clarification, and updated `README.md`, `INDEX.md`, `index.html`, `index.json`, `bookmarks.json`, `bookmarks.html`, and `REVENUE_SHARING.md` files. The user also specifically requested to enumerate all methods of receiving contributions on their own, and provide an easy and convenient way to integrate them alongside the template\u0027s ask/note for contributions. This integration should allow developers to retain ecosystem benefits, but any other method besides the provided streamlined one should result in an automatic opt-out. Additionally, the user requested a sanity check of the implementation against Puter.js documentation and the `ludoplex/puter.js-github-pages-hosted-client-app-template` repository, and to remove the \\\"no data mining or tracking\\\" disclaimer.\\n\\nThe user then requested to implement an automated system for the ecosystem, suggesting the use of Puter.js itself, decentralized database systems like IPFS, a FLOSS blockchain, BitTorrent, magnet links, and I2P.\\n\\nMost recently, the user asked for a description of how the decentralized system interfaces with the resulting Puter.js apps provided by the GitHub template repo, which offers convenient deployment with added discovery benefits.\\n\\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\\n- Puter.js: A JavaScript library for serverless, cloud-powered applications.\\n- GitHub Pages: Hosting for single-file web applications.\\n- Ecosystem Benefits: App Index, Cross-App Integration, Puter.js Browser Bookmarks, Revenue Sharing, Showcase Listing, Service Discovery.\\n- Revenue Model: Per-app revenue sharing based on GitHub stars, with separate developer-owned donation options.\\n- Attribution: Required for ecosystem participation.\\n- GitHub Actions: Automated workflows for deployment, CI/CD, and milestone promotion.\\n- JSON and Markdown: Formats for app directory and documentation.\\n- Browser Bookmarks: JSON and HTML formats for Puter.js browser integration.\\n- Stripe: Implied payment processor for template contributions.\\n- Decentralized Architecture: IPFS, Filecoin, Arweave for storage; Attestation Chain for consensus; BitTorrent/Magnet Links for distribution; I2P/Tor/Lokinet for privacy.\\n- Cryptographic Verification: Ed25519 signatures, SHA256 content hashes.\\n\\n3. Files and Code Sections:\\n- `https://github.com/ludoplex/puter.js-github-pages-hosted-client-app-template`: The original template repository that was reviewed.\\n- `index.html`: The core of the Puter.js single-file application template. It includes the Puter.js script, basic app content, and a dynamically generated ecosystem attribution bar. The user provided a complete `index.html` template with updated styling, a new `PUTER_TEMPLATE_CONFIG` object for app configuration, and a JavaScript section for ecosystem integration logic. This file was updated to include the exclusive ecosystem footer.\\n- `README.md`: The user provided a complete `README.md` for the template, detailing the quick start, ecosystem advantages, app directory, revenue sharing program, Puter.js browser integration, community showcase, and support. It was updated to remove \\\"no tracking\\\" claims.\\n- `DIRECTORY.md`: This file is the full app index, categorizing various Puter.js applications. The user provided a complete `INDEX.md` (renamed to `DIRECTORY.md`) with categories like Developer Tools, Productivity, Creative \u0026 Design, Utilities, Games \u0026 Entertainment, Education, Communication, Finance, and Data \u0026 Analytics.\\n- `ecosystem/directory.json`: This JSON file serves as the machine-readable app index for ecosystem browsing. The user provided a complete `index.json` (renamed to `ecosystem/directory.json`) with app details, categories, and statistics.\\n- `ecosystem/registry.json`: A new file created to store the registry of compliant apps.\\n- `ecosystem/footer.css`: A new file created for the standalone ecosystem footer styles.\\n- `scripts/detect-external-contributions.js`: This script was created to scan deployed apps for external donation/contribution methods.\\n  - It includes `DETECTION_PATTERNS` for platforms, crypto addresses, widgets, semantic keywords, and `FUNDING.yml` indicators.\\n  - It also includes `ALLOWED_PATTERNS` to whitelist the ecosystem\u0027s own contribution link.\\n  - The script was updated to explicitly detect the removal of the ecosystem footer as an opt-out reason.\\n  - The module exports were updated to include `ExternalContributionDetector`, `DETECTION_PATTERNS`, and `ALLOWED_PATTERNS`.\\n  ```javascript\\n  // ============================================================================\\n  // EXTERNAL CONTRIBUTION DETECTION PATTERNS\\n  // ============================================================================\\n\\n  const DETECTION_PATTERNS = {\\n      // Direct Payment Platforms (truncated for brevity)\\n      platforms: [\\n          { pattern: /github\\\\.com\\\\/sponsors\\\\//i, name: \u0027GitHub Sponsors\u0027 },\\n          { pattern: /ko-fi\\\\.com/i, name: \u0027Ko-fi\u0027 },\\n          // ... many more\\n      ],\\n      \\n      // Cryptocurrency Wallet Addresses (truncated for brevity)\\n      crypto: [\\n          { pattern: /\\\\b(bc1[a-zA-HJ-NP-Z0-9]{39,59})\\\\b/, name: \u0027Bitcoin (bech32)\u0027 },\\n          { pattern: /\\\\b(0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40})\\\\b/, name: \u0027Ethereum/EVM Address\u0027 },\\n          // ... more crypto patterns\\n      ],\\n      \\n      // Widget Embeds (truncated for brevity)\\n      widgets: [\\n          { pattern: /kofi-widget/i, name: \u0027Ko-fi Widget\u0027 },\\n          // ... more widget patterns\\n      ],\\n      \\n      // Semantic Keywords Near Links (truncated for brevity)\\n      semanticPatterns: [\\n          { \\n              pattern: /\u003ca[^\u003e]*href=[^\u003e]*\u003e.*?\\\\b(donate|donation|tip|sponsor|support\\\\s*me|buy\\\\s*me|fund|contribute)\\\\b.*?\u003c\\\\/a\u003e/gi, \\n              name: \u0027Donation Link Text\u0027 \\n          },\\n      ],\\n      \\n      // FUNDING.yml indicators (when scanning repo) (truncated for brevity)\\n      fundingYml: [\\n          { pattern: /\\\\.github\\\\/FUNDING\\\\.yml/i, name: \u0027FUNDING.yml Present\u0027 },\\n      ]\\n  };\\n\\n  // Patterns that are ALLOWED (ecosystem contribution link)\\n  const ALLOWED_PATTERNS = [\\n      /data-ecosystem-version/i,\\n      /puter-ecosystem-footer/i,\\n      /ecosystem-contribution-link/i,\\n      /\\\\?ref=puter-ecosystem/i,\\n      /class=[\\\"\u0027].*ecosystem.*[\\\"\u0027]/i,\\n      /buy\\\\.stripe\\\\.com\\\\/\\\\w+\\\\?client_reference_id=\\\\w+/i // Specific pattern for the ecosystem\u0027s Stripe link\\n  ];\\n\\n  // ...

Errors and fixes:\\n- **Error**: `Error: Failed to create Browserbase session: Failed to ensure default session browserbase_session_main_1767909894860 after initial error and retry: Failed to create/connect session browserbase_session_main_1767909894860: Unauthorized. Ensure you provided a valid API key and that it is whitelisted.`\\n  - **Fix**: This error indicated an issue with API key authorization for Browserbase. The assistant did not fix this error but proceeded with other available information, as it was an environmental error not directly related to the code being developed.\\n- **Error**: `Error calling tool: Unable to write file \u0027\\\\index.html\u0027 (NoPermissions (FileSystemError): Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, open \u0027C:\\\\index.html\u0027)`\\n  - **Fix**: The assistant attempted to write `index.html` to the root directory `C:\\\\`. This was corrected by first creating a dedicated directory `puter-app-template` in the user\u0027s home directory and then writing all files within that new directory.\\n- **Error**: `Copy-Item : Cannot find path \u0027C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\puter-app-template\\\\scripts\\\\detect-external-contributions.js\u0027 because it does not exist.`\\n  - **Fix**: This error occurred because the `detect-external-contributions.js` file was not yet created in the target directory when the `Copy-Item` command was executed. The assistant then created the file directly in the correct path.\\n- **Error**: The detection script initially flagged the ecosystem\u0027s own contribution link as an external method.\\n  - **Fix**: The `ALLOWED_PATTERNS` in `scripts/detect-external-contributions.js` were updated to specifically whitelist the ecosystem\u0027s Stripe payment link pattern, ensuring it is not incorrectly identified as a violation.\\n\\n5. Problem Solving:\\n- The initial problem was to define a complete ecosystem specification and an exclusive contribution model. This was addressed by creating detailed documentation (`README.md`, `EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md`), a compliance detection script (`scripts/detect-external-contributions.js`), and a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/verify-ecosystem.yml`) for automated enforcement.\\n- A specific user query about a developer removing the payment and verification part (ecosystem footer) was addressed by enhancing the `detect-external-contributions.js` script to explicitly check for the presence of the ecosystem footer and report its absence as a `FOOTER_REMOVED` opt-out reason. The GitHub Actions workflow and `EXCLUSIVE_MODEL.md` were updated to reflect this.\\n- The user then requested to implement a decentralized automated system. This was addressed by designing and implementing several modules for IPFS storage, an attestation chain, BitTorrent distribution, and a privacy layer (I2P/Tor), all orchestrated by a central `ecosystem-node.js`. A `DECENTRALIZED_ARCHITECTURE.md` document was also created.\\n\\n6. All user messages:\\n- \\\"Puter.js Template Ecosystem - Complete Specification 1. Ecosystem Overview text ... 2.

We also include sample applications for you to play around with!\\\\n3 **DEVELOPER GUIDES** show you how to use the library to achieve a specific goal 4 **API REFERENCE** describes all classes and functions, as well as their available parameters and types\\\\n\\\\n### Results from [Server-side Inference in Node.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/tutorials/node)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Excerpt from the \\\\\\\"Creating a basic HTTP server\\\\\\\" section\\\\n\\\\nNext, let\u0027s create a basic server with the built-in [HTTP](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http) module We will listen for requests made to the server (using the `/classify` endpoint), extract the `text` query parameter, and run this through the pipeline ```javascript\\\\n// Define the HTTP server\\\\nconst server = http.createServer();\\\\nconst hostname = \u0027127.0.0.1\u0027;\\\\nconst port = 3000;\\\\n// Listen for requests made to the server\\\\nserver.on(\u0027request\u0027, async (req, res) =\u003e {\\\\n  // Parse the request URL\\\\n  const parsedUrl = url.parse(req.url);\\\\n  // Extract the query parameters\\\\n  const { text } = querystring.parse(parsedUrl.query);\\\\n  // Set the response headers\\\\n  res.setHeader(\u0027Content-Type\u0027, \u0027application/json\u0027);\\\\n  let response;\\\\n  if (parsedUrl.pathname === \u0027/classify\u0027 \u0026\u0026 text) {\\\\n    const classifier = await MyClassificationPipeline.getInstance();\\\\n    response = await classifier(text);\\\\n    res.statusCode = 200;\\\\n  } else {\\\\n    response = { \u0027error\u0027: \u0027Bad request\u0027 }\\\\n    res.statusCode = 400;\\\\n  }\\\\n  // Send the JSON response\\\\n  res.end(JSON.stringify(response));\\\\n});\\\\nserver.listen(port, hostname, () =\u003e {\\\\n  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);\\\\n});\\\\n``` \\\\nSince we use lazy loading, the first request made to the server will also be responsible for loading the pipeline If you would like to begin loading the pipeline as soon as the server starts running, you can add the following line of code after defining `MyClassificationPipeline`: ```javascript\\\\nMyClassificationPipeline.getInstance();\\\\n``` \\\\nTo start the server, run the following command: ```bash\\\\nnode app.js\\\\n``` The server should be live at http://127.0.0.1:3000/, which you can visit in your web browser You should see the following message: ```json\\\\n{\\\\\\\"error\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Bad request\\\\\\\"}\\\\n``` This is because we aren\u0027t targeting the `/classify` endpoint with a valid `text` query parameter Let\u0027s try again, this time with a valid request For example, you can visit http://127.0.0.1:3000/classify?text=I%20love%20Transformers.js and you should see:\\\\n\\\\n### Results from [Building a Vanilla JavaScript Application](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/tutorials/vanilla-js)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Excerpt from the \\\\\\\"Step 2: JavaScript setup\\\\\\\" section\\\\n\\\\nWith the *boring* part out of the way, let\u0027s start writing some JavaScript code!
