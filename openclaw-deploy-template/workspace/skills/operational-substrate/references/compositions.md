# Compositions Reference

Full operator algebra for the Seven Lenses.

## Pairwise Compositions

### GF — Strategic Decomposition
Take apart the power plays.
- "How does the scam actually work?"
- "What's the mechanism of the manipulation?"
- "Decompose the con"

### FG — Decompose the Strategy
Find the gears behind the games.
- "Why would a rational actor build this system?"
- "What game does this mechanism serve?"
- "The structure implies the strategy"

### RB — Seek Then Update
Find then believe proportionally.
- "Find it, then weigh it"
- "Search is evidence too"
- "What you find (and don't) updates the map"

### BR — Update About Where to Seek
Let beliefs guide search.
- "Where would it be if I'm right?"
- "Search where the hypothesis points"
- "Posterior as query"

### EX — Economics of Experimentation
What does it cost to test? Who can afford to know?
- "Who can afford to run this experiment?"
- "Why hasn't this been tested? Follow the money."
- "Verification is expensive. Who pays?"

### XE — Test the Economic Model
Does predicted behavior match observed?
- "If the incentives are real, they should be visible"
- "Poke the market and see what bleeds"
- "Economic prediction is testable prediction"

### LR — Formalize the Topology
Map the information space precisely.
- "What's the type signature of this search space?"
- "Define the structure before searching it"
- "Precision about where things are"

### RL — Seek the Formalizations
Where do precise people put precise things?
- "Where do proofs live?"
- "Find the people who can't tolerate ambiguity"
- "The formal stuff has addresses"

### GR — Strategic Topology
Who controls what regions of information space?
- "Who owns this part of the map?"
- "What territory are they defending?"
- "Information control is strategic control"

### RG — Seek the Strategy
Find where actors reveal their games.
- "Where do they slip up?"
- "Find the leaks in the strategic facade"
- "Actions documented somewhere"

### FB — Decompose the Belief
What parts of your prior rest on what foundations?
- "Where does my confidence come from?"
- "Take apart why you think this"
- "The belief has structure. Find it."

### BF — Update Your Decomposition
Does new evidence change how you think it works?
- "Does this change the mechanism?"
- "Surprising evidence means wrong model"
- "Update the structure, not just the probability"

### EG — Economic Game
What's the resource structure of the strategic interaction?
- "What can they afford to do?"
- "Follow the budget"
- "Strategy constrained by resources"

### GE — Strategic Economics
How do actors manipulate economic information?
- "Who benefits from this price signal?"
- "Markets are games too"
- "Economic information is strategic asset"

### LX — Formalize the Test
Express the experiment precisely.
- "What exactly are we measuring?"
- "Operationalize before experimenting"
- "Precise prediction, precise test"

### XL — Test the Formalization
Does the formal model survive contact with reality?
- "The proof is wrong if reality disagrees"
- "Formal structure is hypothesis too"
- "Math doesn't protect from wrong assumptions"

### LB — Formalize the Belief
Express the prior precisely.
- "What exactly am I claiming?"
- "Type-check the hypothesis"
- "Precision reveals hidden assumptions"

### BL — Update the Formalization
Does evidence require revising the formal structure?
- "Was the formalization wrong?"
- "Update the model, not just parameters"
- "Evidence can break the frame"

### FE — Decompose the Economics
How does the money actually flow?
- "What's the mechanism of the incentive?"
- "Trace the actual transactions"
- "Economics has gears too"

### EF — Economic Decomposition
What's the cost structure of understanding?
- "What does it cost to know how this works?"
- "Who pays to maintain obscurity?"
- "Understanding has price tags"

### GX — Strategic Testing
How do actors respond to being tested?
- "If I poke, what do they do?"
- "Testing is intervention"
- "Observation changes the game"

### XG — Test the Strategy
Does the predicted game play out?
- "If they're playing this game, what would we see?"
- "Strategy implies observable behavior"
- "Poke and watch the response"

## Fusion Patterns

### Game-Economic Fusion (GE)
Incentive structures as both strategic and economic objects.

Memes:
- "Follow both the money and the moves"
- "Budget constrains strategy"
- "Economic position is strategic position"

### Feynman-Bayesian Fusion (FB)
Decomposition informs priors. Structure of understanding affects belief.

Memes:
- "Mechanism confidence → belief confidence"
- "Gaps in understanding → uncertainty in belief"
- "Decompose to calibrate"

### Fravia-Logical Fusion (RL)
Precise specification of information topology.

Memes:
- "Type signature of the search space"
- "Formal map of information territory"
- "Precision about where things are"

### Experimental-Economic Fusion (XE)
Testing as resource allocation. Verification as market.

Memes:
- "Testing costs. Who pays?"
- "Verification is expensive. That's informative."
- "The market for truth has friction"

### Feynman-Experimental Fusion (FX)
Decomposition generates testable predictions. Every component is a hypothesis.

Memes:
- "Each gear is a prediction"
- "Decompose to testable parts"
- "The model has moving parts. Poke each one."
- "Mechanism implies experiment"

### Full Stack (GRFBEXL)
Who's hiding it (G), where (R), how does the hiding work (F), what should I believe about it (B), what did it cost to hide (E), how do I test that (X), and can I say it precisely (L)?

Memes:
- "The full interrogation"
- "All lenses, one target"
- "Leave no facet unexamined"
- "Convergent assault"

## Seven-Chains

Example chain: F(G) → R(G(F)) → B(R(G(F))) → E(B(R(G(F)))) → X(E(B(R(G(F))))) → L(X(E(B(R(G(F))))))

**F(G)**: Decompose strategic reasoning itself. How do incentives actually propagate? Where do game-theoretic models lie about their own mechanisms?

**G(F)**: Who benefits from things being understood? Who benefits from jargon? Teaching as power move. Obscurity as moat.

**R(G(F))**: Where do people discuss the strategic value of understanding? Find the meta-discourse. Consultants selling clarity. Academics defending opacity.

**B(R(G(F)))**: Given what you found about who discusses strategic understanding where, what should you believe about the landscape? Update.

**E(B(R(G(F))))**: What's the cost structure of this belief-forming process? Whose budget paid for the discourse you found? Who profits from your updated belief?

**X(E(B(R(G(F)))))**: Test it. Did following the money predict the content? Run the experiment. Check your model against what you find.

**L(X(E(B(R(G(F))))))**: Express the experimental result formally. Is the structure you found actually there, or did you pattern-match noise?

That's one seven-chain. There are 5,879 others. They emerge when needed.
