# Curriculum Scaffold

## Bloom's Verbs (by level)
| Level | Verbs | Assessment |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Remember | list, define, recall | Quiz |
| Understand | explain, summarize | Short answer |
| Apply | use, implement, solve | Lab/Exercise |
| Analyze | compare, contrast, debug | Case study |
| Evaluate | critique, justify | Peer review |
| Create | design, build, compose | Project |

## Objective Formula
```
[Audience] will [Bloom verb] [topic] by [condition/method].
```
Example: "Students will implement OAuth2 by building a login flow."

## Module Structure
```
Module N: [Title] (X hours)
├── Objectives (3-5 SMART)
├── Pre-requisites
├── Content
│   ├── Lecture/Reading (concepts)
│   ├── Demo (worked example)
│   └── Lab (hands-on)
├── Assessment
└── Resources
```

## Decomposition Flow
1. Define end competency
2. Break into 4-8 modules
3. 3-5 objectives per module
4. Map each objective → content + assessment

## Gotchas
- One verb per objective (testable)
- "Understand" is vague—prefer "explain"
- Time estimate: 3x content length for learners
