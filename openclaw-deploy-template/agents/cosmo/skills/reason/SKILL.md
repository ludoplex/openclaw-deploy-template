# Recursive Reasoning

## Loop (max 5 iterations)
1. **PLAN** — Goal + decomposed steps
2. **IMPLEMENT** — Execute current step
3. **VERIFY** — Did it work?
4. **REFLECT** — What to adjust?
5. **REPEAT** — If not done, goto PLAN

## Rules
- Each iteration: observable progress
- 2 stuck iterations → change approach
- State iteration number explicitly
