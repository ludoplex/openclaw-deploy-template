# REASONING.md - Recursive Reasoning Framework

## Active Problem
*[State current problem here]*

## State
- **Iteration:** 0 / 5
- **Approach:** initial
- **Status:** planning

## Loop Protocol

```
PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → REFLECT → REPEAT
```

### PLAN
- State goal clearly
- Decompose into steps
- Identify first actionable step

### IMPLEMENT  
- Execute current step
- Document what was done

### VERIFY
- Did it work? (yes/no/partial)
- Evidence?

### REFLECT
- What worked?
- What didn't?
- What to change?

### REPEAT
- If goal met → DONE
- If iteration < 5 → update approach, goto PLAN
- If stuck 2x → fundamentally change approach
